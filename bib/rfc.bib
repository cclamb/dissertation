   gateway or destination host will communicate with a source host, for
   example, to report an error in datagram processing.  For such
   purposes this protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),
   is used.  ICMP, uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher

PAGES=15,

YEAR=1984,
ABSTRACT={The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as
one Internet network has generated some interest and concern. It is
inappropriate to give each LAN within a site a distinct ARPA-Internet
network number. It is desirable to hide the details of the
interconnections between the LANs within a site from people, gateways,
and hosts outside the site. The question arises on how to best do this,
and even how to do it at all. In RFC 917, Jeffery Mogul makes a case for
the use of {"}explicit subnets{"} in a multi-LAN environment. The explicit
subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the

ABSTRACT="There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use
of a single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical
networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest
of the Internet by a common route. Such schemes allow a simplified view
of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of
this collection. They allow the complexity of the number and type of
these networks, and routing to them, to be localized. Additions and
changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no
interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other
information outside of the local environment. These schemes also
simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require
allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed. This
proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at
the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984. This RFC

ABSTRACT="Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected

are of little interest to the rest of the Internet. One way of
organizing these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as
the Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to
be an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices
that perform routing functions (like gateways). This general scheme is
called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).

environments in the ARPA-Internet. Distribution of this memo is

this mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family. The mechanism
is not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option

those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator

ABSTRACT="The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular

prior work on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer
management. In this memo, the case of a packet switch with infinite
storage is considered. Such a packet switch can never run out of
buffers. It can, however, still become congested. The meaning of
congestion in an infinite-storage system is explored. An unexpected
result is found that shows a datagram network with infinite storage,
first-in-first-out queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite
packet lifetime will, under overload, drop all packets. By attacking the
problem of congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions
applicable to switches with finite storage may be found. No proposed
solutions this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet

Here, we argue that the form of {"}best effort{"} reliability provided by

are building fault tolerant software. Our basic premise is that reliable
handling of failures, recoveries, and dynamic process migration are
important aspects of programming in distributed environments, and that
communication support that provides unpredictable behavior in the
presence of such events places an unacceptable burden of complexity on
higher level application software. This complexity does not arise when
using the fault-tolerant process group alternative.},

which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-
organizing, hierarchical master-slave configuration synchronizes logical
clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire or
radio. The servers can also redistribute reference time via local
routing algorithms and time daemons. The NTP architectures, algorithms
and protocols which have evolved over several years of implementation
and refinement are described in this document. The prototype system,
which has been in regular operation in the Internet for the last two
years, is described in an Appendix along with performance data which
shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet
can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds, even
the cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers or nets. This

PAGES=46,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=nov,
YEAR=1988,
ABSTRACT="This memo presents the results of a working group on High
Bandwidth Networking. This RFC is for your information and you are
encouraged to comment on the issues presented. Use of Gigabit scale
networks include supercomputer imaging, Miltary C2 and sensor data
distribution from space. A Gigabit Network (GN) must support these
services: - Currently Provided Packet Services - Multi-Media Mail -
Multi-Media Conferencing - Computer Generated Real Time Graphics -
High-Speed Transaction Processing - Wide Area Distributed
Database/Knowledge Base Management Systems For a stream or synchronous
service a reservation system is used to set up and guarantee a constant
and steady amount of bandwidth between any two subscribers. For Gigabit
Backbones (GB), LAN speeds should be able to change irrespective of GB
speeds and vice versa. Directory services such as those found in CCITT
X.500/ISO DIS 9594 need to be provided. Usage policy is expressed by a
tariff which is upheld by accounting. Routing policies are enforced by
traffic controls. Trusted and secure communications on GNs is provided
by authentication, integrity, confidentiality, access control, and
nonrepudiation. Speeds of trunks in the next generation networks is
rising faster than the speeds of the switching elements. New designs of
switch are required to handle expensive but large bandwidths without the
switch becoming the bottleneck. Hierarchically designed networks may be
the key to managability in the next generation networks. Reliablity is
needed in future networks and is achieved through the use of
fault-tolerant switches, distributed control with self-correcting
algorithms and the protection of network control traffic. Architecture
of future networks must be divorced from the underlying transmission
technology. There is a heirarchy of progressively more effective network
management techniques: 1) Reactive Problem Management 2) Reactive
Resource Management 3) Proactive Problem Management 4) Proactive
Resource Management To prevent information overflow on human operators,
the system with have to provide increasing amounts of filtering.
thresholding and altering mechanisms. Expert systems capable of early
fault detection, diagnosis and problem resolution will become mandatory
for GNs. High level entities should have a name or logical address that
identifies them independently of location. Multicast should be provided
as a user level service as in RFC1054 for IP. The GN will alsmost
certainly be made up from point to point fibre links that will not
provide broadcast or multicast for free. Open group multicast means that
any host can multicast to the group; closed group multicast means that
only hosts which are members of the group may multicast to the group.
Closed group multicasting is adequate for applications such as
conferencing but open group multicasting is required for more
client-server applications such as file and database servers. TCP places
the checksum in the packet header, forcing the packet to be formed and
read fully before transmission can begin. ISO TP4 is worse than TCP in
that the checksum is in a variable location in the header and thus
hardware implementation is made very difficult. Special purpose
transport protocols can be designed for applications with more stringent
requirements than generic transport protocols (such as TCP and ISO TP4)
can provide. Current special purpose transport protocols include: o UDP
(user datagram protocol) o RDP (reliable datagram protocol) o LDP
(loader/debugger protocol) o NETBLT (high-speed block transfer protocol)
o NVP (network voice protocol) o PVP (packet video protocol) New generic
transport protocols such as VMTP hope to offer a wide range of service
options that help remove the need to resort to special purpose
protocols. New transport protocols should not be over optimised for
current networks and yet must not ignore the fundamental deficiencies of
current protocols. Forward Error Correction (FEC) is useful when the
bandwidth/delay ratio of the physical medium is high (ie photonic
transcontinental or transatlantic links). Operating systems must be
refined to the level of performance required of them for use with a
gigabit/sec network. Decentralised approaches to network management
should be emphasised over centralised systems. Compromising the security
of one part of a GN should not compromise the security of the entire
network. With changes future bandwidth and computing costs and
performance ratios, the trade off between user data and network control
data flows needs to be re-explored. Resource requests made by an
application to the network system must be in real terms desipte the fact
that most operating systems attempt to present a 'virtual world' to the
application level code. A protocol implementation can adapt to changes
in that [lower level] service by tuning its internal mechanisms
(time-outs, retransmission strategies, etc.)''. To minimise the effects
of failures in future networks, the system must reconfigure itself to
adapt to the new network state when a failure occurs. Small messages
(that fit into one RTD such as those generated by most applications
today) will require open-loop controls on flow and congestion. Large
messages (those taking longer than one RTD such as voice or video
streams) will require explicit resource commitment. The speed of light
and queuing delays are the most critical sources of delay faces future
gigabit/sec networks. Depending upon the actual (physical) size of the
network, the application layer programs can expect to experience delays
which differe by several orders of magnitude. The current Internet is
more or less unmanagable and is having problems with network
administrators using one logical subnet address to cover widely
geographically dispersed LANs connected with fibre or satelite links.
Routing can be based on policy (such as access rights) instead of simply
minimising some 'cost' such as delay. Connectionless protocols make
imposing a policy difficult and increase processing overhead, especially
at gateways, as no state is kept and policy decisions must be made for
every packet. Variables which can be taken into account in policy based
routing include: o Classes of users (ie large, small, commerical,
governmental, academic, etc), o) Classes of Service (what quality is
required), o) Time varying (on or off peak transmission), o) Volume
(discount and surcharges), o) Access charges (per port or bandwidth of
the ports in use), o) Distance (circuit miles, as the crow flies, number
of hops). A list of 'current' (as of November 1988) research efforts in
the USA is given.",

ABSTRACT={RFC 1006 describes a mechanism for providing the ISO transport
service on top of TCP/IP. Once this method is applied, one may implement
{"}real{"} ISO applications on top of TCP/IP-based internets, by simply
implementing OSI session, presentation, and application services on top
of the transport service access point which is provided on top of the
TCP. Although straight-forward, there are some environments in which the
richness provided by the OSI application layer is desired, but it is
nonetheless impractical to implement the underlying OSI infrastructure
(i.e., the presentation, session, and transport services on top of the
TCP). This memo describes an approach for providing {"}stream-lined{"}
support of OSI application services on top of TCP/IP-based internets for
such constrained environments. This memo proposes a standard for the

TITLE="Measured performance of the Network Time Protocol in the Internet system",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1128,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=oct,
YEAR=1989,
ABSTRACT="This paper describes a series of experiments involving over
100,000 hosts of the Internet system and located in the U.S., Europe and
the Pacific. The experiments are designed to evaluate the availability,
accuracy and reliability of international standard time distribution
using the DARPA/NSF Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which
is specified in RFC-1119. NTP is designed specifically for use in a
large, diverse internet system operating at speeds from mundane to
lightwave. In NTP a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a
self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration exchange
precision timestamps in order to synchronize subnet clocks to each other
and national time standards via wire or radio. The experiments are
designed to locate Internet hosts and gateways that provide time by one
of three time distribution protocols and evaluate the accuracy of their
indications. For those hosts that support NTP, the experiments determine
the distribution of errors and other statistics over paths spanning
major portions of the globe. Finally, the experiments evaluate the
accuracy and reliability of precision timekeeping using NTP and typical
Internet paths involving DARPA, NSFNET and other agency networks. The
experiments demonstrate that timekeeping accuracy throughout most
portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few
tens of milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks,
time servers or networks. This memo does not specify a standard.",

ABSTRACT="This memo describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP) designed
to distribute time information in a large, diverse internet system
operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave. It uses a returnable-
time architecture in which a distributed subnet of time servers
operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave configuration
synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time
standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute time
information within a network via local routing algorithms and time
daemons. The architectures, algorithms and protocols which have evolved
to NTP over several years of implementation and refinement are described
in this paper. The synchronization subnet which has been in regular
operation in the Internet for the last several years is described along
with performance data which shows that timekeeping accuracy throughout
most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a
few tens of milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of
clocks, time servers or networks. This memo describes the Network Time
Protocol in RFC-1119.",

TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1203,
PAGES=49,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=feb,
YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT={The intent of the Interactive Mail Access Protocol, Version 3
(IMAP3) is to allow a (possibly unreliable) workstation or similar
machine to access electronic mail from a reliable mailbox server in an
efficient manner. Although different in many ways from POP2 (RFC 937),
IMAP3 may be thought of as a functional superset of POP2, and the POP2
RFC was used as a model for this RFC. There was a cognizant reason for
this; RFC 937 deals with an identical problem and it was desirable to
offer a basis for comparison. Like POP2, IMAP3 specifies a means of
accessing stored mail and not of posting mail; this function is handled
by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP (RFC 821). A comparison with
the DMSP protocol of PCMAIL can be found at the end of {"}System Model and
Philosophy{"} section. This protocol assumes a reliable data stream such
as provided by TCP or any similar protocol. When TCP is used, the IMAP
server listens on port 220. When CHAOS is used the IMAP server listens
for the logical contact name {"}IMAP3{"}. Communication in IMAP is defined
to be using the ASCII character interpretation of data. Communication
using other conventions may be possible by the selection of features on
some servers.},

ABSTRACT="Operating systems for personal computers do not provide a
mechanism for user authentication. However, such a mechanism is crucial
for electronic mail system since authenticating message sender's
identity is important in preventing mail forgery. Hence, adding personal
computers to an electronic mail network requires an agent (message
posting server) to authenticate sender's identity and then submit mail
to the message delivery system (e.g., Sendmail, MMDF) on behalf of the
sender at a PC. The Netix Message Posting Protocol is developed to be
the interface between the message posting server and the PC (client).
The protocol is designed to use TCP and is based on the command and
reply structures defined for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC 821) and
File Transfer Protocol (RFC 959).",

TITLE="On the assignment of subnet numbers",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1219,
PAGES=13,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=apr,
YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT={RFC-950 specifies a procedure for subnetting Internet
addresses using a bit-mask. While RFC-950 allows the {"}ones{"} in the
subnet mask to be non-contiguous, RFC-950 recommends that 1) they be
contiguous, and 2) that they occupy the most significant bits of the
{"}host{"} part of the internet address. RFC-950 did not specify whether
different subnets of the same network may have different masks. This
ambiguity was unfortunate, as it resulted in development of routing
protocols that do not support different masks; see e.g., RIP. The
Gateway Requirements RFC settled the issue in favor of allowing
different masks, and therefore future routing protocols may be expected
to support this feature; OSPF is an example. The network administrator
must of course determine the mask for each subnet. This involves making
an estimate of how many hosts each subnet is expected to have. As it is
often impossible to predict how large each subnet will grow, inefficient
choices are often made, with some subnets under-utilized, and others
possibly requiring renumbering because of exceeded capacity. This memo
specifies a procedure for assigning subnet numbers that eliminates the
need to estimate subnet size. Essentially, host bits (mask = 0) are
assigned from the least significant bit working towards the most, and
subnet bits (mask = 1) are assigned from the most significant bit
working towards the least. As subnets grow, more host bits are assigned.
As the number of subnets grows, more subnet bits are assigned. While
this process does sometimes result},

TITLE="Host Access Protocol {(HAP)} specification: Version 2",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1221,
PAGES=68,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=apr,
YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT={The Host Access Protocol (HAP) is a network layer protocol (as
is X.25). ({"}Network layer{"} here means ISO layer 3 lower, the protocol
layer below the DoD Internet Protocol (IP) layer and above any link
layer protocol.) HAP defines the different types of host-to- network
control messages and host-to-host data messages that may be exchanged
over the access link connecting a host and the network packet switch
node. The protocol establishes formats for these messages, and describes
procedures for determining when each type of message should be
transmitted and what it means when one is received. HAP has been
implemented in the wide-area network called the Terrestrial Wideband
Network (TWBNET) and in the routers and other hosts that connect to
TWBNET. The packet switch nodes that compose the TWBNET are called
Wideband Packet Switches (WPS). Both the precursor to HAP, the
Host/SATNET Protocol, used in the Atlantic Packet Satellite Network
(SATNET) and the Mobile Access Terminal Network (MATNET), and HAP, used
in the original Wideband Satellite Network (WBNET), were originally
designed to provide efficient access to the single satellite channel
each network used to connect all sites. The HAP protocol designers
reflected some of the peculiarities of the single satellite channel
environment in the HAP protocol itself. The current Terrestrial Wideband
Network (TWBNET) utilizes T1-speed fiber connections between sites.
Future networks and TWBNET may use a combination of terrestrial
connections and satellite connections, and may have more than one of
each. The HAP protocol has been changed to accommodate these extensions.
Section 2 presents an overview of HAP. Details of HAP formats and
message exchange procedures are contained in Sections 3 through 10.
Further explanation of some of the topics addressed in this HAP
specification can be found elsewhere. Any protocol employed to provide
sufficiently reliable message exchange over the Host-WPS link is assumed
to be transparent to the protocol defined in this document. Examples of
such link-level protocols are ARPANET 1822 local and distant host,
ARPANET VDH protocol, and HDLC.},

PAGES=12,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=jun,
YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT={The Coherent File Distribution Protocol (CFDP) has been
designed to speed up one-to-many file transfer operations that exhibit
traffic coherence on media with broadcast capability. Examples of such
coherent file transfers are identical diskless workstations booting
simultaneously, software upgrades being distributed to more than one
machines at a site, a certain {"}object{"} (bitmap, graph, plain text,
etc.)
that is being discussed in a real-time electronic conference or class
being sent to all participants, and so on. In all these cases, we have a
limited number of servers, usually only one, and <n> clients (where <n>
can be large) that are being sent the same file. If these files are sent
via multiple one-to-one transfers, the load on both the server and the
network is greatly increased, as the same data are sent <n> times. We
propose a file distribution protocol that takes advantage of the
broadcast nature of the communications medium (e.g., fiber, ethernet,
packet radio) to drastically reduce the time needed for file transfer
and the impact on the file server and the network. While this protocol
was developed to allow the simultaneous booting of diskless workstations
over our experimental packet-radio network, it can be used in any
situation where coherent transfers take place. CFDP was originally
designed as a back-end protocol; a front-end interface (to convert file
names and requests for them to file handles) is still needed, but a
number of existing protocols can be adapted to use with CFDP. Two such
reference applications have been developed; one is for diskless booting
of workstations, a simplified},

YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT="In the past, MIBs have been assigned arcs in the experimental
MIB namespace early in their development and then were not assigned arcs
in the standard MIB namespace until they reached Full Standard status.
This practice required vendors to revise their implementations when a
MIB went from Draft to Full Standard status, even though there was
probably no substantive technical change in the definitions. This
practice could also engender operational problems in the field at an
undesirably late stage of the standardization process. It was also
observed that this practice could discourage implementation until the
Full Standard stage and that this, too, would be undesirable. So, a
preferable practice is to assign arcs in the standard MIB namespace at
the earliest phase of standardization and to preserve these assignments
as the standard progresses.",

NUMBER=1240,
PAGES=8,

MONTH=jun,
YEAR=1991,
ABSTRACT="The Internet community has a well-developed, mature set of
layered transport and network protocols, which are quite successful in
offering both connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP)
transport services over connectionless network services (IP) to end-
users. Many popular network applications have been built directly on top
of the TCP and UDP over the past decade. These have helped the Internet
services and protocols to become widely-spread de facto standards. In
the past few years, the ISO and CCITT have defined a well-architected
set of upper layer standards which include connection-oriented and
connectionless session, presentation, and application layer services and
protocols. These OSI upper layer standards offer valuable services to
application developers (e.g., dialogue control, transfer syntax, peer
authentication, directory services, etc.) which are not currently
offered by the TCP/IP standards. As indicated in RFC 1006, it is
desirable to offer the OSI upper layer services directly in the Internet
without disrupting existing facilities. This permits a more graceful
convergence and transition strategy from IP-based networks to OSI-based
networks in the future. Using the approach of RFC 1006, this memo
specifies how to offer OSI connectionless transport service using the
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) (RFC768) of the TCP/IP suite. We will
define a Transport Service Access Point (TSAP) which appears",

link- state based routing protocol. It is designed to be run internal to
a single Autonomous System. Each OSPF router maintains an identical
database describing the Autonomous System's topology. From this
database, a routing table is calculated by constructing a shortest-path
tree. OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic. OSPF provides
support for equal-cost multipath. Separate routes can be calculated for
each IP type of service. An area routing capability is provided,
enabling an additional level of routing protection and a reduction in
routing protocol traffic. In addition, all OSPF routing protocol
exchanges are authenticated. Version 1 of the OSPF protocol was
documented in RFC 1131. The differences between the two versions are
explained in Appendix F. Please send comments to ospf(at)trantor.umd.edu.",

ABSTRACT={A debate has begun about the future of America's
communications infrastructure. At stake is the future of the web of
information links organically evolving from computer and telephone
systems. By the end of the next decade, these links will connect nearly
all homes and businesses in the U.S. They will serve as the main
channels for commerce, learning, education, and entertainment in our
society. The new information infrastructure will not be created in a
single step: neither by a massive infusion of public funds, nor with the
private capital of a few tycoons, such as those who built the railroads.
Rather the national, public broadband digital network will emerge from
the {"}convergence{"} of the public telephone network, the cable television
distribution system, and other networks such as the Internet. The United
States Congress is now taking a critical step toward what I call the
National Public Network, with its authorization of the National Research
and Education Network (NREN, pronounced {"}en-ren{"}). Not only will the
NREN meet the computer and communication needs of scientists,
researchers, and educators, but also, if properly implemented, it could
demonstrate how a broadband network can be used in the future. As policy
makers debate the role of the public telephone and other existing
information networks in the nation's information infrastructure, the
NREN can serve as a working test-bed for new technologies, applications,
and governing policies that will ultimately shape the larger national
network. Congress has indicated its intention that the NREN would
provide American researchers and educators with the computer and
information resources they need, while demonstrating how advanced
computer, high speed networks, and electronic databases can improve the
national information infrastructure for use by all Americans.},

ABSTRACT="Some requirements on extensions to X.500 are described in the
RFC, in order to build an Internet Directory using X.500(1988). This
document specifies a set of solutions to the problems raised. These
solutions are based on some work done for the QUIPU implementation, and
demonstrated to be effective in a number of directory pilots. By
documenting a de facto standard, rapid progress can be made towards a
full-scale pilot. These procedures are an INTERIM approach. There are
known deficiencies, both in terms of manageability and scalability.
Transition to standard approaches are planned when appropriate standards
are available.",

NUMBER=1310,
PAGES=23,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1992,
ABSTRACT={This memo documents the process currently used for the
standardization of Internet protocols and procedures. The Internet, a
loosely-organized international collaboration of autonomous,
interconnected networks, supports host-to-host communication through
voluntary adherence to open protocols and procedures defined by Internet
Standards. There are also many isolated internets, i.e., sets of
interconnected networks, that are not connected to the Internet but use
the Internet Standards. The architecture and technical specifications of
the Internet are the result of numerous research and development
activities conducted over a period of two decades, performed by the
network R\&D community, by service and equipment vendors, and by
government agencies around the world. In general, an Internet Standard
is a specification that is stable and well-understood, is technically
competent, has multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations
with operational experience, enjoys significant public support, and is
recognizably useful in some or all parts of the Internet. The principal
set of Internet Standards is commonly known as the {"}TCP/IP protocol
suite{"}. As the Internet evolves, new protocols and services, in
particular those for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), have been and
will be deployed in traditional TCP/IP environments, leading to an
Internet that supports multiple protocol suites. This document concerns
all protocols, procedures, and conventions used in the Internet, not
just the TCP/IP protocols. In outline, the process of creating an
Internet Standard is straightforward: a specification undergoes a period
of development and several iterations of review by the Internet
community and perhaps revision based upon experience, is adopted as a
Standard by the appropriate body (see below), and is published. In
practice, the process is somewhat more complicated, due to (1) the

ABSTRACT={This document defines a standard file format for the exchange

of the Network Fax Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force

multi-page files supported. Images should be encoded as one TIFF strip
per page. ** Images should be compressed using MMR when possible. Images
may also be MH or MR compressed or uncompressed. If MH or MR compression
is used, scan lines should be {"}byte-aligned{"}. ** For maximum
interoperability, image resolutions should either be 600, 400, or 300
dpi; or else be one of the standard Group 3 fax resolutions (98 or 196
dpi vertically and 204 dpi horizontally). Note that this specification
is self contained and an implementation should be possible without
recourse to the TIFF references, and that only the specific TIFF
documents cited are relevant to this specification. Updates to the TIFF
documents do not change this specification. Experimentation with this
file format specified here is encouraged.},

than MD4, but is more ``conservative'' in design. MD5 was designed
because it was felt that MD4 was perhaps being adopted for use more
quickly than justified by the existing critical review; because MD4 was
designed to be exceptionally fast, it is ``at the edge'' in terms of
risking successful cryptanalytic attack. MD5 backs off a bit, giving up
a little in speed for a much greater likelihood of ultimate security. It
incorporates some suggestions made by various reviewers, and contains
additional optimizations. The MD5 algorithm is being placed in the

is achieved through the ESnet Site Coordinating Committee (ESCC). This
committee is comprised of one technical contact person from each
backbone site, as well as some members of the ESnet management and
networking staff. As the need for new levels of ESnet services arise,
the ESCC typically creates task forces to investigate and research
issues relating to these new services. Each task force usually results
in a whitepaper which makes recommendations to the ESnet community on
how these services should be deployed to meet the mission of DOE/OER.

ABSTRACT="RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol which
specifies considerable detail about message headers, but which leaves
the message content, or message body, as flat ASCII text. This document
redefines the format of message bodies to allow multi-part textual and
non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged without loss
of information. This is based on earlier work documented in RFC 934 and
RFC 1049, but extends and revises that work. Because RFC 822 said so
little about message bodies, this document is largely orthogonal to
(rather than a revision of) RFC 822. In particular, this document is
designed to provide facilities to include multiple objects in a single
message, to represent body text in character sets other than US-ASCII,
to represent formatted multi-font text messages, to represent
non-textual material such as images and audio fragments, and generally
to facilitate later extensions defining new types of Internet mail for
use by cooperating mail agents. This document does NOT extend Internet
mail header fields to permit anything other than US-ASCII text data. It

ABSTRACT="This memo suggests a file format to be used to inform multiple
mail reading user agent programs about the locally-installed facilities
for handling mail in various formats. The mechanism is explicitly
designed to work with mail systems based Internet mail as defined by
RFC's 821, 822, 934, 1049, 1113, and the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions, known as MIME. However, with some extensions it could
probably be made to work for X.400-based mail systems as well. The
format and mechanism are proposed in a manner that is generally
operating-system independent. However, certain implementation details
will inevitably reflect operating system differences, some of which will
have to be handled in a uniform manner for each operating system. This
memo makes such situations explicit, and, in an appendix, suggests a
standard behavior under the UNIX operating system.",

ABSTRACT="The recent development of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail

system systems. Most of these opportunites are relevant only to user
agents, the programs that interact with human users when they send and

transport systems. While MIME was carefully designed so that it does not
require any changes to Internet electronic message transport facilities,
there are several ways in which message transport systems may want to
take advantage of MIME. These opportunities are the subject of this

network minimize the monetary cost of transmitting a datagram. A number
of additional new TOS values are reserved for future experimentation and
standardization. The ability to request that transmission be optimized
along multiple axes (previously accomplished by setting multiple TOS
bits simultaneously) is removed. Thus, for example, a single datagram
can no longer request that the network simultaneously minimize delay and
maximize throughput. In addition, there is a minor conflict between the
Host Requirements (RFC-1122 and RFC-1123) and a number of other
standards concerning the sizes of the fields in the Type of Service

mechanism and the IP addressing plan will help the the size of the
Internet router forwarding tables and management of the IP address
space. By doing so, it will help the current Internet addressing and
routing technology operate during the interim period until the next
generation technology is deployed. This interim solution in no way
constrains the selection of the next generation addressing and routing
technology. This draft schedule was put together by the FNC Engineering
and Planning Group (FEPG) based on the IP addressing plan BOF of the
July 1992 IETF meeting, as well as discussions with a number (though, of
course, not all) of knowledgeable and interested parties, including the
IANA and IR. This draft schedule assumes that the address aggregation
mechanism will be available in the Internet by mid-1993. The activities
described in this schedule are the precursors to that deployment, and
will promote the efficient operation of that mechanism. We feel that our
assumptions are realistic and that this schedule can be met. We
encourage its open discussion as we move toward community consensus.

PAGES=31,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=dec,
YEAR=1992,
ABSTRACT={1.1 The Internet Domain Name System The Domain Name System
(DNS) provides for the translation between host names and addresses.
Within the Internet, this means translating from a name such as
{"}venera.isi.edu{"}, to an IP address such as {"}128.9.0.32{"}. The DNS is
a
set of protocols and databases. The protocols define the syntax and
semantics for a query language to ask questions about information
located by DNS-style names. The databases are distributed and
replicated. There is no dependence on a single central server, and each
part of the database is provided in at least two servers. The assignment
of the 32-bit IP addresses is a separate activity. IP addresses are
assigned by the Network Information Center (Hostmaster(at)NIC.DDN.MIL). In
addition to translating names to addresses for hosts that are on the
Internet, the DNS provides for registering DNS-style names for other
hosts reachable (via electronic mail) through gateways or mail relays.
The records for such name registration point to an Internet host (one
with an IP address) that acts as a mail forwarder for the registered
host. For example, the host {"}bah.rochester.ny.us{"} is registered in the
DNS with a pointer to the mail relay {"}relay1.uu.net{"}. This type of
pointer is called an MX record. This gives electronic mail users a
uniform mail addressing syntax and avoids making users aware of the
underlying network boundaries. The reason for the development of the
domain system was growth in the Internet. The host name to address
mappings were maintained by the Network Information Center (NIC) in a
single file, called HOSTS.TXT, which was FTPed by all the hosts on the
Internet. The network population was changing in character. The
timeshared hosts that made up the original ARPANET were being replaced
with local networks of workstations. Local organizations were
administering their own names and addresses, but had to wait for the NIC
to make changes in HOSTS.TXT to make the changes visible to the Internet
at large. Organizations also wanted some local structure on the name
space. The applications on the Internet were getting more sophisticated
and creating a need for general purpose name service. The idea of a
hierarchical name space, with the hierarchy roughly corresponding to
organizational structure, and names using {"}.{"} as the character to mark
the boundary between hierarcy levels. A design using a distributed
database and generalized resources was implemented. The domain system
provides standard formats for resource data,},

This edition introduces Tag 14 for Merit Dump File, Tag 15 for Domain

and personal computers proliferate on the Internet, the administrative
complexity of maintaining a network is increased by an order of
magnitude. The assignment of local network resources to each client
represents one such difficulty. In most environments, delegating such
responsibility to the user is not plausible and, indeed, the solution is
to define the resources in uniform terms, and to automate their
assignment. The basic Bootstrap Protocol (RFC-951) dealt with the issue
of assigning an internet address to a client, as well as a few other
resources. The protocol included provisions for vendor-defined resource
information. This memo defines a (potentially) vendor-independent

ABSTRACT="This memo describes the method by which the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) as specified in RFC XXX can be used over
AppleTalk protocols instead of the Internet UDP/IP protocol stack. This
specification is useful for network elements which have AppleTalk
support but lack TCP/IP support. It should be noted that if a network
element supports multiple protocol stacks, and UDP is available, it is
the preferred network layer to use. SNMP has been successful in managing
Internet capable network elements which support the protocol stack at
least through UDP, the connectionless Internet transport layer protocol.
As originally designed, SNMP is capable of running over any reasonable
transport mechanism (not necessarily a transport protocol) that supports
bi- directional flow and addressability. Many non-Internet capable
network elements are present in networks. Some of these elements are
equipped with the AppleTalk protocols. One method of using SNMP to
manage these elements is to define a method of transmitting an SNMP
message inside an AppleTalk protocol data unit. This RFC is the product
of the SNMP over a Multi-protocol Internet Working Group of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).",

take to retrieve the file(s) sent. Unlike traditional file transfer, UFT

ABSTRACT={This is a slightly edited reprint of RARE Technical Report

the three main proposals for replacing the current Internet Protocol. It
is not intended to be exhaustive or definitive (a brief bibliography at
the end points to sources of more information), but to serve as input to
the European discussions on these proposals, to be co-ordinated by RARE
and RIPE. It should be recognised that the proposals are themselves
{"}moving targets{"}, and in so far as this paper is accurate at all, it
reflects the position at the 25th IETF meeting in Washington, DC.
Comments from Ross Callon and Paul Tsuchiya on the original draft have
been incorporated. Note that for a time the term {"}IPv7{"} was use to mean
the eventual next version of IP, but that the same term was closely
associated with a particilar proposal, so the term {"}IPng{"} is now used
to
identify the eventual next generation of IP. The paper begins with a
{"}generic{"} discussion of the mechanisms for solving problems and
achieving particular goals, before discussing the proposals invidually.},

PAGES=31,

ABSTRACT="The usage of the X.400 Message Handling System (MHS) is
growing rapidly, especially in the commercial world but much interest
can also be found in the academic and research community. New networks
and new addresses come into use each and every day. The underlying
technology for different X.400 networks can vary depending on the
transport network and the X.400 MHS implementations used. As a large
number of X.400 implementations now support multiple stacks, this offers
the chance of implementing a world wide message handling service using
the same electronic mail standard and, therefore, without the need of
gateways with service reduction and without the restriction to a single
common transport network. This, however, leads to several problems for
the MHS manager, two of which are: - Where do I route new X.400
addresses and - How do I connect to a MHS domain that uses an underlying
technology that I do not support. This document proposes short term
solutions to these problems. It proposes a strategy for maintaining and
distributing routing information and shows how messages can travel over
different networks by using multi stack MTAs as relays. Document formats
and coordination procedures bridge the gap until an X.500 directory
service is ready to store the needed connectivity and routing
information. The format has been designed to allow the information to be
stored in an X.500 directory service while managers without directory
service access may still use a table based approach. The routing
structure proposed can be applied to a global MHS service",

ABSTRACT={The Domain Name System (DNS) provides for the translation
between hostnames and addresses. Within the Internet, this means
translating from a name such as {"}venera.isi.edu{"}, to an IP address such
as {"}128.9.0.32{"}. The DNS is a set of protocols and databases. The
protocols define the syntax and semantics for a query language to ask
questions about information located by DNS-style names. The databases
are distributed and replicated. There is no dependence on a single
central server, and each part of the database is provided in at least
two servers. The assignment of the 32-bit IP addresses is a separate
activity. IP addresses are delegated by the central Internet Registry to
regional authorities (such as the RIPE NCC for Europe) and the network
providers. To have a network number assigned please contact your network
service provider or regional registration authority. To determine who
this is (or as a last resort), you can contact the central Internet
Registry at Hostmaster(at)INTERNIC.NET. In addition to translating names to
addresses for hosts that are on the Internet, the DNS provides for
registering DNS-style names for other hosts reachable (via electronic
mail) through gateways or mail relays. The records for such name
registrations point to an Internet host (one with an IP address) that
acts as a mail forwarder for the registered host. For example, the host
{"}bah.rochester.ny.us{"} is registered in the DNS with a pointer to the
mail relay {"}relay1.uu.net{"}. This type of pointer is called an MX
record.
This gives electronic mail users a uniform mail addressing syntax and
avoids making users aware of the underlying network boundaries. The
reason for the development of the domain system was growth in the
Internet. The hostname to address mappings were maintained by the
InterNIC in a single file, called HOSTS.TXT, which was FTP'd by all the
hosts on the Internet. The network population was changing in character.
The time-share hosts that made up the original ARPANET were being
replaced with local networks of workstations. Local organizations were
administering their own names and addresses, but had to wait for the NIC
to make changes in HOSTS.TXT to make the changes visible to the Internet
at large. Organizations also wanted some local structure on the name
space. The applications on the Internet were getting more sophisticated
and creating a need for general purpose name service. The idea of a

PAGES=39,

MONTH=aug,
YEAR=1993,
ABSTRACT={There are many ways in which X.400 and Internet (STD 11, RFC
822) mail systems can be interconnected. Addresses and service elements
can be mapped onto each other in different ways. From the early
available gateway implementations, one was not necessarily better than
another, but the sole fact that each handled the mappings in a different
way led to major interworking problems, especially when a message (or
address) crossed more than one gateway. The need for one global standard
on how to implement X.400 - Internet mail gatewaying was satisfied by
the Internet Request For Comments 1327, titled {"}Mapping between
X.400(1988)/ISO 10021 and RFC 822.{"} This tutorial was produced
especially to help new gateway managers find their way into the
complicated subject of mail gatewaying according to RFC 1327. The need
for such a tutorial can be illustrated by quoting the following
discouraging paragraph from RFC 1327, chapter 1: {"}Warning: the remainder
of this specification is technically detailed. It will not make sense,
except in the context of RFC 822 and X.400 (1988). Do not attempt to
read this document unless you are familiar with these specifications.{"}
The introduction of this tutorial is general enough to be read not only
by gateway managers, but also by e-mail managers who are new to
gatewaying or to one of the two e-mail worlds in general. Parts of this
introduction can be skipped as needed. For novice end-users, even this
tutorial will be difficult to read. They are encouraged to use the
COSINE MHS pocket user guide instead. To a certain extent, this document
can also be used as a reference guide to X.400 <-> RFC 822 gatewaying.
Wherever there is a lack of detail in the tutorial, it will at least
point to the corresponding chapters in other documents. As such, it
shields the RFC 1327 novice},

ABSTRACT="The IETF's Common Authentication Technology (CAT) working
group has pursued, and continues to pursue, several interrelated
activities, involving definition of service interfaces as well as
protocols. As a goal, it has sought to separate security implementation
tasks from integration of security data elements into caller protocols,
enabling those tasks to be partitioned and performed separately by
implementors with different areas of expertise. This strategy is
intended to provide leverage for the IETF community's security- oriented
resources (by allowing a single security implementation to be integrated
with, and used by, multiple caller protocols), and to allow protocol
implementors to focus on the functions that their protocols are designed
to provide rather than on characteristics of particular security
mechanisms (by defining an abstract service which multiple mechanisms
can realize). The CAT WG has worked towards agreement on a common
service interface, (the Generic Security Service Application Program
Interface, or GSS-API), allowing callers to invoke security functions,
and also towards agreement on a common security token format
incorporating means to identify the mechanism type in conjunction with
which security data elements should be interpreted. The GSS-API,
comprising a mechanism-independent model for security integration,
provides authentication services (peer entity authentication) to a
variety of protocol callers in a manner which insulates those callers
from the specifics of underlying security mechanisms. With certain
underlying mechanisms, per-message protection facilities (data origin
authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality) can also be
provided. This work is represented in a pair of RFCs: RFC-1508 (GSS-API)
and RFC-1509 (concrete bindings realizing the GSS-API for the C
language).",

ABSTRACT="This memo defines extensions to the Remote Network Monitoring
MIB for managing 802.5 Token Ring networks. The Remote Network
Monitoring MIB, RFC 1271, defines a framework for remote monitoring
functions implemented on a network probe. That MIB defines objects
broken down into nine functional groups. Some of those functional
groups, the statistics and the history groups, have a view of the
data-link layer that is specific to the media type and require specific
objects to be defined for each media type. RFC 1271 defined those
specific objects necessary for Ethernet. This companion memo defines
those specific objects necessary for Token Ring LANs. In addition, this
memo defines some additional monitoring functions specifically for Token
Ring. These are defined in the Ring Station Group, the Ring Station
Order Group, the Ring Station Configuration Group, and the Source
Routing Statistics Group.",

ABSTRACT={Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) has been adopted as a
solution to the scaling problem in the Internet. The overall CIDR
architecture is described in RFC XXX. The architecture for IP address
assignment with CIDR is covered in RFC XXX and RFC XXX. The inter-domain
routing protocols that are capable of supporting CIDR are covered in RFC
XXX. The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it describes
various alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information
across domain boundaries, where one of the peering domain is
CIDR-capable and another is not. Second, it addresses the implications
of running CIDR-capable inter-domain routing protocols (e.g., BGP-4,
IDRP) on intra-domain routing. This document is not intended to cover
all the cases (either real or imaginable). Rather, it focuses on what
are viewed to be the most common cases. We expect that individual
service providers will use this document as guidelines in establishing
their specific operational plans for the transition to CIDR. The
concepts of {"}network service provider{"} and {"}network service
subscriber{"}
were introduced in RFC XXX. For the sake of brevity, we will use the
term {"}provider{"} or {"}service provider{"} here to mean either
{"}network
service provider{"} or {"}network service subscriber{"}, since for the most
part, the distinction is not important to this discussion. Furthermore,
we use the same terms to refer to the network and to the organization
that operates the network. We feel that the context makes it amply clear
whether we are talking about hardware or people, and defining different
terms would only make this paper harder to read.},

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1521,
PAGES=81,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=sep,
YEAR=1993,
ABSTRACT="STD 11, RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol
which specifies considerable detail about message headers, but which
leaves the message content, or message body, as flat ASCII text. This
document redefines the format of message bodies to allow multi-part
textual and non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged
without loss of information. This is based on earlier work documented in
RFC 934 and STD 11, RFC 1049, but extends and revises that work. Because
RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, this document is largely
orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822. In particular, this
document is designed to provide facilities to include multiple objects
in a single message, to represent body text in character sets other than
US-ASCII, to represent formatted multi- font text messages, to represent
non-textual material such as images and audio fragments, and generally
to facilitate later extensions defining new types of Internet mail for
use by cooperating mail agents. This document does NOT extend Internet
mail header fields to permit anything other than US-ASCII text data.
Such extensions are the subject of a companion document (RFC 1522). This
document is a revision of RFC 1341. Significant differences from RFC
1341 are summarized in Appendix H.",

ABSTRACT="This memo suggests a file format to be used to inform multiple

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, known as MIME. However, with some
extensions it could probably be made to work for X.400-based mail
systems as well. The format and mechanism are proposed in a manner that
is generally operating-system independent. However, certain
implementation details will inevitably reflect operating system
differences, some of which will have to be handled in a uniform manner
for each operating system. This memo makes such situations explicit,
and, in an appendix, suggests a standard behavior under the UNIX

the next thing we should be asking is, what would be some of the
political choices that would follow for Congress to make? It is
unfortunate that this was never officially done for or by the Congress
by OTA. What we have as a result is network policy making being carried
out now by the Science Subcommittee on the House side in consultation
with a relatively small group of interested parties. The debate seems to
be more focused on preserving turf than on any sweeping understanding of
what the legislation is doing. That is unfortunate. In the hope that it
may contain some useful ideas, I offer a shortened version of the

ABSTRACT="This document defines the initial principles of operation for

applies only to those Internet sites that choose to register themselves
within the tpc.int subdomain. The tpc.int subdomain is organized as a
cooperative of the sites that provide access within the context of the
subdomain. Policy for the subdomain is set by a board responsible to the
cooperative. The primary purpose of the tpc.int subdomain is to provide
transparent mapping between general-purpose computers on the Internet
and special-purpose devices directly connected to the telephone network.
Initially, a remote printing service is defined which ties together
G3-compatible facsimile devices on the telephone network with users of
electronic mail in the Internet and associated message-handling domains
connected to the Internet by application- layer gateways. It should be
noted that remote printer gateways have long been technically feasible
and have become an integral part of many individual networks. The
tpc.int subdomain integrates individual sites into a common namespace,
transforming remote printing from a single-site, value-added service
into an integral transparent service in the global Internet.",

ABSTRACT="The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method
for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP
is comprised of three main components: 1. A method for encapsulating
multi-protocol datagrams. 2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for
establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection. 3. A
family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines the
PPP organization and methodology, and the PPP encapsulation, together
with an extensible option negotiation mechanism which is able to
negotiate a rich assortment of configuration parameters and provides
additional management functions. The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) is
described in terms of this mechanism. This document is the product of

position for goals and approaches for the IETF/IESG/IAB in these areas.
It takes the view that these two topics are related, and proposes
directions for the IETF/IESG/IAB to pursue. In particular, it recommends
that the IETF/IESG/IAB should continue to be a force for consensus on a
single protocol suite and internet layer protocol. The IETF/IESG/IAB
should: - maintain its focus on the TCP/IP protocol suite, - work to
select a single next-generation internet protocol and develop mechanisms
to aid in transition from the current IPv4, and - continue to explore
mechanisms to interoperate and share resources with other protocol
suites within the Internet.",

offers a means of conveying bigger network addresses (with additional

each application-related association. This MIB may be used on its own
for any application, and for most simple applications this will suffice.
This MIB is also designed to serve as a building block which can be used
in conjunction with application-specific monitoring and management. Two
examples of this are MIBs defining additional variables for monitoring a
Message Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory Service Agent (DSA)
service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature will be
specified. This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for
management of the host or hosts the network service application runs on,
nor does it provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide
something other than a network service. Host resource and general

ABSTRACT="Running routing protocols on connection oriented Public Data
Networks, for example X.25 packet switched networks or ISDN, can be
expensive if the standard form of periodic broadcasting of routing
information is adhered to. The high cost arises because a connection has
to all practical intents and purposes be kept open to every destination
to which routing information is to be sent, whether or not it is being
used to carry user data. Routing information may also fail to be
propagated if the number of destinations to which the routing
information is to be sent exceeds the number of channels available to
the router on the Wide Area Network (WAN). This memo defines a
generalized modification which can be applied to Bellman-Ford (or
distance vector) algorithm information broadcasting protocols, for
example IP RIP, Netware RIP or Netware SAP, which overcomes the
limitations of the traditional methods described above. The routing
protocols support a purely triggered update mechanism on demand circuits
on WANs. The protocols run UNMODIFIED on LANs or fixed point-to-point
links. Routing information is sent on the WAN when the routing database
is modified by new routing information received from another interface.
When this happens a (triggered) update is sent to a list of destinations
on other WAN interfaces. Because routing protocols are datagram based
they are not guaranteed to be received by the peer router on the WAN. An
acknowledgement and retransmission mechanism is provided to ensure that
routing updates are received.",

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1583,
PAGES=216,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT="This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol. OSPF is a
link-state routing protocol. It is designed to be run internal to a
single Autonomous System. Each OSPF router maintains an identical
database describing the Autonomous System's topology. From this
database, a routing table is calculated by constructing a shortest- path
tree. OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic. OSPF provides
support for equal-cost multipath. Separate routes can be calculated for
each IP Type of Service. An area routing capability is provided,
enabling an additional level of routing protection and a reduction in
routing protocol traffic. In addition, all OSPF routing protocol
exchanges are authenticated. OSPF Version 2 was originally documented in
RFC 1247. The differences between RFC 1247 and this memo are explained
in Appendix E. The differences consist of bug fixes and clarifications,
and are backward-compatible in nature. Implementations of RFC 1247 and
of this memo will interoperate. Please send comments to

NUMBER=1584,
PAGES=102,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT="This memo documents enhancements to the OSPF protocol enabling
the routing of IP multicast datagrams. In this proposal, an IP multicast
packet is routed based both on the packet's source and its multicast
destination (commonly referred to as source/destination routing). As it
is routed, the multicast packet follows a shortest path to each
multicast destination. During packet forwarding, any commonality of
paths is exploited; when multiple hosts belong to a single multicast
group, a multicast packet will be replicated only when the paths to the
separate hosts diverge. OSPF, a link-state routing protocol, provides a
database describing the Autonomous System's topology. A new OSPF link
state advertisement is added describing the location of multicast
destinations. A multicast packet's path is then calculated by building a
pruned shortest-path tree rooted at the packet's IP source. These trees
are built on demand, and the results of the calculation are cached for
use by subsequent packets. The multicast extensions are built on top of
OSPF Version 2. The extensions have been implemented so that a multicast
routing capability can be introduced piecemeal into an OSPF Version 2
routing domain. Some of the OSPF Version 2 routers may run the multicast
extensions, while others may continue to be restricted to the forwarding
of regular IP traffic (unicasts). Please send comments to

PAGES=37,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT="This memorandum describes an engineering model which
implements a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating
system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators
and phase-lock loops (PLL) often found in the engineering literature. It
has been implemented in the Unix kernel for several workstations,
including those made by Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment. The
model changes the way the system clock is adjusted in time and
frequency, as well as provides mechanisms to discipline its frequency to
an external precision timing source. The model incorporates a generic
system-call interface for use with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or
similar time synchronization protocol. The NTP Version 3 daemon xntpd
operates with this model to provide synchronization limited in principle
only by the accuracy and stability of the external timing source. This
memorandum does not obsolete or update any RFC. It does not propose a
standard protocol, specification or algorithm. It is intended to provoke
comment, refinement and alternative implementations. While a working
knowledge of NTP is not required for an understanding of the design
principles or implementation of the model, it may be helpful in
understanding how the model behaves in a fully functional timekeeping
system. The architecture and design of NTP is described elsewhere, while
the current NTP Version 3 protocol specification is given in RFC-1305
and a subset of the protocol, the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP),
in RFC-1361. The model has been implemented in three Unix kernels for
Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment workstations. In addition, for
the Digital machines the model provides improved precision to one
microsecond (us). Since these specific implementations involve
modifications to licensed code, they cannot be provided directly.

ABSTRACT="This report summarises the requirements of research and
academic network users for network access to multimedia information. It
does this by investigating some of the projects planned or currently
underway in the community. Existing information systems such as Gopher,
WAIS and World-Wide Web are examined from the point of view of
multimedia support, and some interesting hypermedia systems emerging
from the research community are also studied. Relevant existing and
developing standards in this area are discussed. The report identifies
the gaps between the capabilities of currentlydeployed systems and the
user requirements, and proposes further work centred on the World-Wide
Web system to rectify this. The report is in some places very detailed,
so it is preceded by an extended summary, which outlines the findings of

ABSTRACT="The European research and development community, as
represented by the member research networks of RARE, has lead the
deployment within the global R\&D community of X.400 electronic messaging
services, as specified in the international recommendations CCITT
X.400(1984), for more than five years. As a result of providing such
services to the European R\&D users it has become clear that there is an
existing and ever increasing demand from these users for new and
enhanced electronic messaging services and product to be used to
communicate within the R\&D community but within commercial service
providers and organisations as well. It is also clear that new services,
such as Multimedia messaging and Secure messaging, and the resulting
products promise dramatic benefits and opportunities, for not only the
R\&D community but also for the wider commercial, industrial and public
communities, in terms of facilitating innovative ways of working and
living which can only enhance the missions and goals of the respective
communities. Not least the establishment of globally pervasive messaging
services between all users, R\&D and commercial, is facilitated by the
early adoption of such advanced new services. An indication of the
importance of such a messaging service can be appreciated if one
considers that in many organizations (especially commercially based)
messaging may be the only method to communicate between independent
organizations due to security considerations and lower layer network
differences. The Commission of European Communities (CEC) VALUE
subprogram II has been established to support initiatives relating to
the development and adaptation of R\&D networks in member states. Amongst

PAGES=28,
DAYS=15,

ABSTRACT="This document defines the syntax used by the World-Wide Web
initiative to encode the names and addresses of objects on the Internet.
The web is considered to include objects accessed using an extendable
number of protocols, existing, invented for the web itself, or to be
invented in the future. Access instructions for an individual object
under a given protocol are encoded into forms of address string. Other
protocols allow the use of object names of various forms. In order to
abstract the idea of a generic object, the web needs the concepts of the
universal set of objects, and of the universal set of names or addresses
of objects. A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a member of this
universal set of names in registered name spaces and addresses referring
to registered protocols or name spaces. A Uniform Resource Locator
(URL), defined elsewhere, is a form of URI which expresses an address
which maps onto an access algorithm using network protocols. Existing
URI schemes which correspond to the (still mutating) concept of IETF
URLs are listed here. The Uniform Resource Name (URN) debate attempts to
define a name space (and presumably resolution protocols) for persistent
object names. This area is not addressed by this document, which is
written in order to document existing practice and provide a reference
point for URL and URN discussions.",

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1631,
PAGES=10,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=may,
YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT="The two most compelling problems facing the IP Internet are IP
address depletion and scaling in routing. Long-term and short-term
solutions to these problems are being developed. The short-term solution
is CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing). The long-term solutions consist
of various proposals for new internet protocols with larger addresses.
It is possible that CIDR will not be adequate to maintain the IP
Internet until the long-term solutions are in place. This memo proposes
another short-term solution, address reuse, that complements CIDR or
even makes it unnecessary. The address reuse solution is to place
Network Address Translators (NAT) at the borders of stub domains. Each
NAT box has a table consisting of pairs of local IP addresses and
globally unique addresses. The IP addresses inside the stub domain are
not globally unique. They are reused in other domains, thus solving the
address depletion problem. The globally unique IP addresses are assigned
according to current CIDR address allocation schemes. CIDR solves the
scaling problem. The main advantage of NAT is that it can be installed
without changes to routers or hosts. This memo presents a preliminary
design for NAT, and discusses its pros and cons.",

ABSTRACT={This document describes a protocol that more fully supports
3270 devices than do the existing tn3270 practices. Specifically, it
defines a method of emulating both the terminal and printer members of
the 3270 family of devices via Telnet; it provides for the ability of a
Telnet client to request that it be assigned a specific device- name
(also referred to as {"}LU name{"} or {"}network name{"}); finally, it adds
support for a variety of functions such as the ATTN key, the SYSREQ key,
and SNA response handling. This protocol would be negotiated and
implemented under a new Telnet Option and would be unrelated to the
Telnet 3270 Regime Option as defined in RFC 1041.},

ABSTRACT="There are several large, operational X.400 services currently
deployed. Many of the organizations in these services are connected to
the Internet. A number of other Internet-connected organizations are
beginning to operate internal X.400 services (for example, U.S.
government organizations following U.S. GOSIP). The motivation for this
document is to foster a Global Open Message Handling System (GO-MHS)
Community that has full interoperability with the existing E-mail
service based on RFC-822 (STD-11). The goal of this document is to unite
regionally operated X.400 services on the various continents into one
GO-MHS Community (as seen from an end-user's point of view). Examples of
such regional services are the COSINE MHS Service in Europe and the
XNREN service in the U.S. A successful GO-MHS Community is dependent on
decisions at both the national and international level. National X.400
service providers are responsible for the implementation of the minimum
requirements defined in this document. In addition to these minimum
requirements, national requirements may be defined by each national
service provider. This document refers to other documents which are
published as RFCs. This document handles issues concerning X.400 1984
and X.400 1988 to 1984 downgrading. Issues concerning pure X.400 1988
are left for further study.",

ABSTRACT={Border Gateway Protocol v4 (BGP-4) is an inter-Autonomous
System routing protocol. It is built on experience gained with BGP as
defined in RFC-1267 and BGP usage in the connected Internet as described
in RFC-1268. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to
exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This
network reachability information includes information on the list of
Autonomous Systems (ASs) that reachability information traverses. This
information is sufficient to construct a graph of AS connectivity from
which routing loops may be pruned and some policy decisions at the AS
level may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a new set of mechanisms for
supporting classless inter-domain routing. These mechanisms include
support for advertising an IP prefix and eliminates the concept of
network {"}class{"} within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms which
allow
aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. These changes
provide support for the proposed supernetting scheme. The management
information base has been defined and security considerations are
discussed in the protocol definition document.},

an electronic White Pages Service is therefore indispensable. The
document provides an introduction to the international ITU-T (formerly
CCITT) X.500 and ISO 9594 standard, which is particularly suited for
providing an integrated local and global electronic White Pages Service.
In addition a short overview of the experience gained from the Paradise
X.500 pilot is given. References to more detailed information are
included. The document should be useful for managers of the above
mentioned organisations who need to get the necessary executive
commitment for making the address information of their organisation
available by means of X.500.",

attack, are not strong enough to be appropriate in the current Internet.
Further, there is ample evidence that both passive and active attacks
are not uncommon in the current Internet. The authors of this paper
believe that many protocols used in the Internet should have stronger
authentication mechanisms so that they are at least protected from
passive attacks.",

Transport layer protocol (TCP/UDP). The purpose of this TA is to
uniquely identify an Internet node without specifying any routing

describing the new header fields and formats. This new version of TCP
would contain support for high bandwidth-delay networks. Support for
multiple network layer (Internet Protocol) protocols is also possible
with this new TCP. Assigning an address to TCP/UDP would allow for the
support of multiple network layer protocols (IPng's). The TA would
identify the location of an Internet node. The IPng layer would provide

adopters of technology, with technical staff dedicated to the planning
for and implementation of leading edge technology. The K-12 community
traditionally has not had this level of staffing available for
telecommunications planning. This document is intended to bridge that
gap and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to
the role the Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical
guidelines for building a campus data communications infrastructure that

Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is used to describe a routing entity, which
can be an X.400 MTA, a UNIX mailer, or any other piece of software
performing mail routing functions. An MTA processes the so called
envelope information of a message. The term User Agent (UA) is used to

ABSTRACT={This document is a snapshot of the work of the Router
Requirements working group as of November 1991. At that time, the
working group had essentially finished its task. There were some final
technical matters to be nailed down, and a great deal of editing needed
to be done in order to get the document ready for publication.
Unfortunately, these tasks were never completed. t the request of the
Internet Area Director, the current editor took the last draft of the
document and, after consulting the mailing list archives, meeting
minutes, notes, and other members of the working group, edited the
document to its current form. This effort included the following tasks:
1) Deleting all the parenthetical material (such as editor's comments).
Useful information was turned into DISCUSSION sections, the rest was
deleted. 2) Completing the tasks listed in the last draft's To be Done
sections. As a part of this task, a new {"}to be done{"} list was developed
and included as an appendix to the current document. 3) Rolling Philip
Almquist's {"}Ruminations on the Next Hop{"} and {"}Ruminations on Route
Leaking{"} into this document. These represent significant work and should
be kept. 4) Fulfilling the last intents of the working group as
determined from the archival material. The intent of this effort was to
get the document into a form suitable for publication as an Historical
RFC so that the significant work which went into the creation of this
document would be preserved. The goal of this work is to replace
RFC-1009, Requirements for Internet Gateways with a new document. This
memo is an intermediate step toward that goal. It defines and discusses
requirements for devices which perform the network layer forwarding
function of the Internet protocol suite. The Internet community usually
refers to such devices as IP routers or simply routers; The OSI
community refers to such devices as intermediate systems. Many older
Internet documents refer to these devices as gateways, a name which more
recently has largely passed out of favor to avoid confusion with
application gateways.},

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=1730,
PAGES=73,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=dec,
YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT={The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4 (IMAP4) allows
a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.
IMAP4 permits manipulation of remote message folders, called
{"}mailboxes{"}, in a way that is functionally equivalent to local
mailboxes. IMAP4 also provides the capability for an offline client to
resynchronize with the server. IMAP4 includes operations for creating,
deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently
removing messages; setting and clearing flags; RFC 822 and MIME parsing;
searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and
portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4 are accessed by the use of numbers.
These numbers are either message sequence numbers (relative position
from 1 to the number of messages in the mailbox) or unique identifiers
(immutable, strictly ascending values assigned to each message, but
which are not necessarily contiguous). IMAP4 supports a single server. A
mechanism for supporting multiple IMAP4 servers is in progress. IMAP4
does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a
mail transfer protocol such as SMTP. IMAP4 is designed to be upwards
compatible from the IMAP2 protocol. Compatibility issues are discussed
in RFC 1732. This RFC is a product of the Internet Message Access
Protocol Working Group of the IETF.},

facilities that were not in earlier specifications should be invisible
to clients unless the client asks for the facility. In some cases, older
servers may support some of the capabilities listed as being {"}new in

PAGES=30,

YEAR=1994,
ABSTRACT="Security systems today are built on increasingly strong
cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However,
the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret
quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities.
The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can
result in pseudo-security. The sophisticated attacker of these security
systems may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced
the secret quantities, searching the resulting small set of
possibilities, than to locate the quantities in the whole of the number
space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated
adversary is surprisingly difficult. This paper points out many pitfalls
in using traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for
choosing such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware
techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be
used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem
when a hardware solution is not available. And it gives examples of how
large such quantities need to be for some particular applications.",

applies to IP hosts and routers which are also ATM endsystems and
assumes ATM networks that completely implement the ATM Forum UNI

made between the Private and Public UNI. UNI 3.1 is considered an
erratum to the UNI 3.0 specification. It has been produced by the ATM

YEAR=1995,
ABSTRACT="Most of network applications run on some sort of transports.
And, if one is to let such applications to run over a foreign network
protocol, the simplest way would be to allow the applications'
transports to run over that network protocol. For TCP/IP applications,
that transport is TCP or UDP. Hence, to let TCP/IP applications run over
IPX, we would need to have TCP and UDP run over IPX. And, once TCP and
UDP are allowed to run over IPX, all TCP and UDP based applications,
such as HTTP for WWW, or NFS, can easily be made to work over IPX
networks. IESG Note: Internet Engineering Steering Group comment from
the Area Director for Transport Services: Please note well that this
memo is an individual product of the author. Implementation experience,
particularly on the effectiveness of the protocols in dual-stack

ABSTRACT="Traditionally, TCP and UDP runs over IP. STD 17, RFC 1213
defines TCP connection MIB object and UDP listener object assuming just
that. For TCP and UDP running over IPX, tcpConnTable and udpTable
objects from RFC 1213 cannot be used since they define the address to be
of type IpAddress. As such, we need to define new objects that can
properly describe TCP and UDP connections over IPX. New MIB objects,
tcpIpxConnTable, udpIpxTable, tcpUnspecConnTable and udpUnspecTable are
presented in this paper, to be used in place of tcpConnTable and
udpListenerTable when TCP and UDP are running over IPX. IESG Note:

ABSTRACT={This memo defines enhancements to the OSPF protocol that allow
efficient operation over {"}demand circuits{"}. Demand circuits are network
segments whose costs vary with usage; charges can be based both on
connect time and on bytes/packets transmitted. Examples of demand
circuits include ISDN circuits, X.25 SVCs, and dial-up lines. The
periodic nature of OSPF routing traffic has until now required a demand
circuit's underlying data-link connection to be constantly open,
resulting in unwanted usage charges. With the modifications described
herein, OSPF Hellos and the refresh of OSPF routing information are
suppressed on demand circuits, allowing the underlying data-link
connections to be closed when not carrying application traffic. This RFC

ABSTRACT={This document describes the registration policies for the

multiple registrations for Federal Agencies and naming schemes that do

restricting registrations to coincide with the approved structure of the
US government. The document cited, FIPS 95-1, provides a standard
recognized structure into which domain registrations for .GOV can be
fit. This policy is exactly comparable to that for the top-level
domains. The IANA requires that an organization/country apply for and
get a 2 letter code from ISO/ITU (e.g., US for United States) for
additional top-level registration. As a side effect, this reduces the
number of .GOV level registrations and reduces the workload on the

ABSTRACT={The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup

structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of
existing bodies of information. HTML has been in use by the World Wide
Web (WWW) global information initiative since 1990. This specification
roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to
June 1994. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information
Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML). The {"}text/html{"} Internet Media Type (RFC 1590) and MIME Content

ABSTRACT="Currently, HTML forms allow the producer of the form to
request information from the user reading the form. These forms have
proven useful in a wide variety of applications in which input from the
user is necessary. However, this capability is limited because HTML
forms don't provide a way to ask the user to submit files of data.
Service providers who need to get files from the user have had to
implement custom user applications. (Examples of these custom browsers
have appeared on the www-talk mailing list.) Since file-upload is a
feature that will benefit many applications, this proposes an extension
to HTML to allow information providers to express file upload requests
uniformly, and a MIME compatible representation for file upload
responses. This also includes a description of a backward compatibility
strategy that allows new servers to interact with the current HTML user
agents. The proposal is independent of which version of HTML it becomes

ABSTRACT="When using MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) to
encapsulate a structured object that consist of many elements, for
example an SGML document, a single element may occur several times. An
encapsulation normally maps each of the structured objects elements to a
MIME entity. It is useful to include elements that occur multiple time
exactly once. To accomplish that and to preserve the object structure it
is desirable to unambiguously refer to another body part of the same
message. The existing MIME Content-Type Message/External-Body
access-types allow a MIME entity (body-part) to refer to an object that
is not in the message by specifying how to access that object. The
Content-ID access method described in this document provides the
capability to refer to an object within the message. This RFC is the

ABSTRACT="A management system contains: several (potentially many)
nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access
to management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
management protocol, used to convey management information between the
agents and management stations. Operations of the protocol are carried
out under an administrative framework which defines authentication,
authorization, access control, and privacy policies. Management stations
execute management applications which monitor and control managed
elements. Managed elements are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal
servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via access to their
management information. Management information is viewed as a collection
of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base (MIB). Collections of related objects are
defined in MIB modules. These modules are written using an adapted
subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). It is the purpose
of this document, the Structure of Management Information (SMI), to
define that adapted subset, and to assign a set of associated

telephone switch and provide call answering and voice messaging

transported using analog networking protocols based on DTMF signaling
and analog voice playback. As the demand for networking increases, there
is a need for a standard high-quality digital protocol to connect these
machines. This RFC is a profile of the Internet standard MIME and ESMTP
protocols for use as a digital voice networking protocol. This profile
is based on an earlier effort in the Audio Message Interchange
Specification (AMIS) group to define a voice messaging protocol based on
X.400 technology. This protocol is intended to satisfy the user
requirements statement from that earlier work with the industry standard
ESMTP/MIME mail protocol infrastructures already used within corporate

PAGES=23,

ABSTRACT={On certain types of smaller nodes in the Internet it is often
impractical to maintain a message transport system (MTS). For example, a
workstation may not have sufficient resources (cycles, disk space) in
order to permit a SMTP server (RFC 821) and associated local mail
delivery system to be kept resident and continuously running. Similarly,
it may be expensive (or impossible) to keep a personal computer
interconnected to an IP-style network for long amounts of time (the node
is lacking the resource known as {"}connectivity{"}). Despite this, it is
often very useful to be able to manage mail on these smaller nodes, and
they often support a user agent (UA) to aid the tasks of mail handling.
To solve this problem, a node which can support an MTS entity offers a
maildrop service to these less endowed nodes. The Post Office Protocol -
Version 3 (POP3) is intended to permit a workstation to dynamically
access a maildrop on a server host in a useful fashion. Usually, this
means that the POP3 protocol is used to allow a workstation to retrieve
mail that the server is holding for it.},

source-initiated selection of routes to complement the route selection
provided by existing routing protocols for both inter-domain and
intra-domain routes. This document refers to such source-initiated
routes as {"}SDRP routes{"}. This document describes the packet format and
forwarding procedure for SDRP. It also describes procedures for
ascertaining feasibility of SDRP routes. Other components not described
here are routing information distribution and route computation. This
portion of the protocol may initially be used with manually configured
routes. The same packet format and processing will be usable with
dynamic route information distribution and computation methods under
development. This RFC is the product of the Source Demand Routing
Working Group of the IETF.},

ABSTRACT="The benefits of multicasting are becoming ever-more apparent,
and its use much more widespread. This is evident from the growth of the
MBONE. Providing security services for multicast, such as traffic
integrity, authentication, and confidentiality, is particularly
problematic since it requires securely distributing a group (session)
key to each of a group's receivers. Traditionally, the key distribution
function has been assigned to a central network entity, or Key
Distribution Centre (KDC), but this method does not scale for wide-area
multicasting, where group members may be widely-distributed across the
internetwork, and a wide-area group may be densely populated. Even more
problematic is the scalable distribution of sender-specific keys.
Sender-specific keys are required if data traffic is to be authenticated
on a per-sender basis. This memo provides a scalable solution to the
multicast key distribution problem.",

of the earlier protocol, are discussed in RFC 2061. A full discussion of

ABSTRACT="The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has been through
several revisions and variants in its 10-year history. Many of these are
either extinct or extremely rare; in particular, several undocumented
variants and the variants described in RFC 1064, RFC 1176, and RFC 1203
fall into this category. One variant, IMAP2bis, is at the time of this
writing very common and has been widely distributed with the Pine
mailer. Unfortunately, there is no definite document describing
IMAP2bis. This document is intended to be read along with RFC 1176 and
the most recent IMAP4 specification (RFC 2060) to assist implementors in
creating an IMAP4 implementation to interoperate with implementations
that conform to earlier specifications. Nothing in this document is
required by the IMAP4 specification; implementors must decide for
themselves whether they want their implementation to fail if it
encounters old software. At the time of this writing, IMAP4 has been
updated from the version described in RFC 1730. An implementor who
wishes to interoperate with both RFC 1730 and RFC 2060 should refer to
both documents.",

YEAR=1997,
ABSTRACT="The X.500 Standard (X.500 93) has the concept of first level
DSAs, whose administrators must collectively manage the root naming
context through bi-lateral agreements or other private means which are
outside the scope of the X.500 Standard. The NameFLOW-Paradise X.500
service has an established procedure for managing the root naming
context, which currently uses Quipu proprietary replication mechanisms
and a root DSA. The benefits that derive from this are twofold: firstly,
it is much easier to co-ordinate the management of the root context
information, when there is a central point of administration, Secondly,
the performance of one-level Search operations is greatly improved
because the Quipu distribution and replication mechanism does not have a
restriction that exists in the 1988 and 1993 X.500 Standard. The
NameFLOW-Paradise project is moving towards 1993 ISO X.500 Standard
replication protocols and wants to standardise the protocol and
procedure for managing the root naming context which will be based on
1993 X.500 Standard protocols. Such a protocol and procedure will be
useful to private X.500 domains as well as to the Internet X.500 public
domain. It is imperative that overall system performance is not degraded
by this transition. This document describes the use of 1993 ISO X.500
Standard protocols for managing the root context. Whilst the ASN.1 is
compatible with that of the X.500 Standard, the actual settings of the
parameters are supplementary to that of the X.500 Standard.",

ABSTRACT={A new URL scheme, {"}vemmi{"} is defined. It allows VEMMI client
software and VEMMI terminals to connect to multimedia interactive
services compliant to the VEMMI standard (Enhanced Man-Machine Interface
for Videotex and Multimedia/Hypermedia Information Retrieval Services),
sometimes abbreviated as {"}VErsatile MultiMedia Interface{"}. VEMMI is a
new international standard for on-line multimedia services, that is both
an ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union, ex. CCITT)
International Standard (T.107) and an European Standard (ETSI European
Telecommunications Standard Institute) standard (ETS 300 382, obsoleted
by ETS 300 709). VEMMI could be described as an on-line multimedia
protocol describing both the man-machine interface and the client/server
exchange protocol. VEMMI operates usually on a single continuous session
between a client and a host and supports an object-oriented, event-
driven, client/server oriented and platform independent multimedia
interface. The well-known tcp port number 575 has been assigned by IANA
to the VEMMI protocol. A description of the VEMMI standard along with
its last approved version is publicly available on the Web: see the URL
http://www.etsi.fr/ecs/projects/vemmi/vemmi.htm). A presentation of
VEMMI can be found on http://www.mctel.fr/VEMMI/vemmien\_intro.html},

ABSTRACT="Mobile IP (RFC 2002) defines media-independent procedures by
which a Mobile Node can maintain existing transport and
application-layer connections despite changing its point-of-attachment
to the Internet and without changing its IP address. PPP (RFC 1661)
provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol packets over
point-to-point links. As currently specified, Mobile IP Foreign Agents
which support Mobile Node connections via PPP can do so only by first
assigning unique addresses to those Mobile Nodes, defeating one of the
primary advantages of Foreign Agents. This documents corrects this
problem by defining the Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option to the Internet
Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) (RFC 1332). Using this option, two
peers can communicate their support for Mobile IP during the IPCP phase
of PPP. Familiarity with Mobile IP (RFC 2002), IPCP (RFC 1332), and PPP
(RFC 1661) is assumed.",

The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual

addresses. The election process provides dynamic fail over in the
forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable. This
allows any of the virtual router IP addresses on the LAN to be used as
the default first hop router by end-hosts. The advantage gained from
using VRRP is a higher availability default path without requiring
configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every

services (a.k.a. PINT services) is that they combine the Internet and
PSTN services in such a way that the Internet is used for non-voice
interactions, while the voice (and fax) are carried entirely over the
PSTN. One key observation is that the pre-PINT implementations, being
developed independently, do not inter-operate. It is a task of the PINT

addition of active queue management (e.g., RED) to the Internet
infrastructure, where routers detect congestion before the queue
overflows, routers are no longer limited to packet drops as an
indication of congestion. Routers could instead set a Congestion
Experienced (CE) bit in the packet header of packets from ECN-capable
transport protocols. We describe when the CE bit would be set in the
routers, and describe what modifications would be needed to TCP to make
it ECN-capable. Modifications to other transport protocols (e.g.,
unreliable unicast or multicast, reliable multicast, other reliable
unicast transport protocols) could be considered as those protocols are

ABSTRACT={The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a
framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
network. Configuration parameters and other control information are
carried in tagged data items that are stored in the 'options' field of
the DHCP message. The data items themselves are also called {"}options.{"}
New DHCP options may be defined after the publication of the DHCP
specification to accommodate requirements for conveyance of new
configuration parameters. This document describes the procedure for
defining new DHCP options.},

administratively configured Point to Point NBMA links are also
described. Dynamic NBMA shortcuts are achieved through the use of IPv6
Neighbor Discovery protocol operation within Logical Links, and
inter-router NHRP for the discovery of off-Link NBMA destinations. Both
flow-triggered and explicitly source-triggered shortcuts are supported.",

a mesh of unicast relations, or a combination of these. SIP invitations
used to create sessions carry session descriptions which allow
participants to agree on a set of compatible media types. SIP supports
user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to the user's current
location. Users can register their current location. SIP is not tied to
any particular conference control protocol. SIP is designed to be
independent of the lower-layer transport protocol and can be extended

ABSTRACT={The de facto standard application program interface (API) for

wide variety of non-Unix systems. TCP/IP applications written using the
sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we
would like the same portability with IPv6 applications. But changes are
required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes
these changes. These include a new socket address structure to carry
IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket
options. These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic
IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including
multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and
providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.
Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access
to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.},

positive (ACK) indicating a short-cut path is available or negative
(NAK) indicating that a shortcut is not available and the routed path
must be used. The NHC must cache (maintain state) for both the ACK and
NAK replies in order to use the correct shortcut or routed path. The NAK
reply must be cached to avoid making repeated requests to the NHS when

ABSTRACT="The SPKI Working Group has developed a standard form for
digital certificates whose main purpose is authorization rather than
authentication. These structures bind either names or explicit
authorizations to keys or other objects. The binding to a key can be
directly to an explicit key, or indirectly through the hash of the key
or a name for it. The name and authorization structures can be used
separately or together. We use S-expressions as the standard format for
these certificates and define a canonical form for those S-expressions.
As part of this development, a mechanism for deriving authorization
decisions from a mixture of certificate types was developed and is
presented in this document. This document gives the theory behind SPKI
certificates and ACLs without going into technical detail about those
structures or their uses.",

ABSTRACT="This document specifies a payload format for generic forward
error correction of media encapsulated in RTP. It is engineered for FEC
algorithms based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation. The payload
format allows end systems to transmit using arbitrary block lengths and
parity schemes. It also allows for the recovery of both the payload and
critical RTP header fields. Since FEC is sent as a separate stream, it
is backwards compatible with non-FEC capable hosts, so that receivers
which do not wish to implement FEC can just ignore the extensions.",

the definition of middleware in general, examined the applications
perspective, detailed underlying network transport capabilities relevant
to middleware services, and then covered various specific examples of
middleware components. These included APIs, authentication,
authorization, and accounting (AAA) issues, policy framework,
directories, resource management, networked information discovery and

MIBs defining additional variables for monitoring a Message Transfer

ABSTRACT="This document defines a Certificate Management protocol using
CMS (CMC). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the
Internet PKI community: 1. The need for an interface to public key
certification products and services based on [CMS] and [PKCS10], and 2.
The need in [SMIMEV3] for a certificate enrollment protocol for
DSA-signed certificates with Diffie-Hellman public keys. A small number
of additional services are defined to supplement the core certificate
request service. Throughout this specification the term CMS is used to
refer to both [CMS] and [PKCS7]. For both signedData and envelopedData,
CMS is a superset of the PKCS7. In general, the use of PKCS7 in this
document is aligned to the Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] that
provides a superset of the PKCS7 syntax. The term CMC refers to this
specification. This document is a product of the Public-Key

tunnels across HTTP proxies. Finally, this memo establishes new IANA

PAGES=7,

ABSTRACT={The goals of the work to {"}internationalize{"} Internet protocols
include providing all users of the Internet with the capability of using
their own language and its standard character set to express themselves,
write names, and to navigate the network. This impacts the domain names
visible in e-mail addresses and so many of today's URLs used to locate
information on the World Wide Web, etc. However, domain names are used
by Internet protocols that are used across national boundaries. These
services must interoperate worldwide, or we risk isolating components of
the network from each other along locale boundaries. This type of
isolation could impede not only communications among people, but
opportunities of the areas involved to participate effectively in
e-commerce, distance learning, and other activities at an international
scale, thereby retarding economic development. There are several
proposals for internationalizing domain names, however it it is still to
be determined whether any of them will ensure this interoperability and
global reach while addressing visible-name representation. Some of them
obviously do not. This document does not attempt to review any specific
proposals, as that is the work of the Internationalized Domain Name
(IDN) Working Group of the IETF, which is tasked with evaluating them in
consideration of the continued global network interoperation that is the
deserved expectation of all Internet users. This document is a statement

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",

PAGES=6,

ABSTRACT="To remain a global network, the Internet requires the
existence of a globally unique public name space. The DNS name space is
a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root.
This is a technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS.
Therefore it is not technically feasible for there to be more than one
root in the public DNS. That one root must be supported by a set of
coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority. Put
simply, deploying multiple public DNS roots would raise a very strong
possibility that users of different ISPs who click on the same link on a
web page could end up at different destinations, against the will of the
web page designers. This does not preclude private networks from
operating their own private name spaces, but if they wish to make use of
names uniquely defined for the global Internet, they have to fetch that
information from the global DNS naming hierarchy, and in particular from
the coordinated root servers of the global DNS naming hierarchy. This

known as Gigabyte System Network (GSN), a physical-level,
point-to-point, full-duplex, link interface for reliable,

is specified in HIPPI-6400-PH Connections to a longer-distance optical
interface are standardized in HIPPI-6400-OPT. HIPPI-6400-PH defines the
encapsulation of IEEE 802.2 LLC PDUs and by implication, IP on GSN.
Another T11.1 standard describes the operation of HIPPI-6400 physical

ABSTRACT="Proxy-PAR is a minimal version of PAR (PNNI Augmented Routing)
that gives ATM-attached devices the ability to interact with PNNI
devices without the necessity to fully support PAR. Proxy-PAR is
designed as a client/server interaction, of which the client side is
much simpler than the server side to allow fast implementation and
deployment. The purpose of Proxy-PAR is to allow non-ATM devices to use
the flooding mechanisms provided by PNNI for registration and automatic
discovery of services offered by ATM attached devices. The first version
of PAR primarily addresses protocols available in IPv4. But it also
contains a generic interface to access the flooding of PNNI. In
addition, Proxy-PAR-capable servers provide filtering based on VPN IDs,
IP protocols and address prefixes. This enables, for instance, routers
in a certain VPN running OSPF to find OSPF neighbors on the same subnet.
The protocol is built using a registration/query approach where devices
can register their services and query for services and protocols
registered by other clients. This document is a product of the

ABSTRACT="This memo specifies, for OSPF implementors and users,
mechanisms describing how the protocol operates in ATM networks over PVC

require no protocol changes and allow simpler, more efficient and

implementations should be able to support logical interfaces, each
consisting of one or more virtual circuits and used either as numbered
logical point-to-point links (one VC), logical NBMA networks (more than
one VC) or Point-to-MultiPoint networks (more than one VC), where a
solution simulating broadcast interfaces is not appropriate. PAR can
help distribute across the ATM cloud configuration setup and changes of
such interfaces when OSPF capable routers are (re-)configured. Proxy-PAR

TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=2852,
PAGES=13,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=jun,
YEAR=2000,
ABSTRACT={This memo defines a mechanism whereby a SMTP client can
request, when transmitting a message to a SMTP server, that the server
deliver the message within a prescribed period of time. A client making
such a request also specifies the message handling which is to occur if
the message cannot be delivered within the specified time period: either
the message is to be returned as undeliverable with no further
processing, or a {"}delayed{"} delivery status notification (DSN) [6] is to
be issued. This extension should not be viewed as a vehicle for
requesting {"}priority{"} processing. A receiving SMTP server may assign
whatever processing priority it wishes to a message transmitted with a
Deliver By request. A Deliver By request serves to express a message's
urgency and to provide an additional degree of determinancy in its
processing. An indication of an urgent message's status within a given
time period may be requested and will be honored. Moreover, the message
may be withdrawn if not delivered within that time period. A typical
usage of this mechanism is to prevent delivery of a message beyond some
future time of significance to the sender or recipient but not known by
the MTAs handling the message. For instance, the sender may know that
the message will be delivered as a page but does not consider the
message to be sufficiently important as to warrant paging the recipient
after business hours. In that case, the message could be marked such
that delivery attempts are not made beyond 17:00. Another common usage
arises when a sender wishes to be alerted to delivery delays. In this
case, the sender can mark a message such that if it is not delivered
within, say, 30 minutes, a {"}delayed{"} DSN is generated but delivery
attempts are nonetheless continued. In this case the sender has been
allowed to express a preference for when they would like to learn of
delivery problems.},

ABSTRACT="TCP's congestion window controls the number of packets a TCP
flow may have in the network at any time. However, long periods when the
sender is idle or application-limited can lead to the invalidation of
the congestion window, in that the congestion window no longer reflects
current information about the state of the network. This document
describes a simple modification to TCP's congestion control algorithms
to decay the congestion window cwnd after the transition from a
sufficiently-long application-limited period, while using the slow-start
threshold ssthresh to save information about the previous value of the
congestion window. An invalid congestion window also results when the
congestion window is increased (i.e., in TCP's slow-start or congestion
avoidance phases) during application-limited periods, when the previous
value of the congestion window might never have been fully utilized. We
propose that the TCP sender should not increase the congestion window
when the TCP sender has been application-limited (and therefore has not
fully used the current congestion window). We have explored these
algorithms both with simulations and with experiments from an
implementation in FreeBSD. This document is a product of the Transport

duplicate packets. This note suggests that when duplicate packets are
received, the first block of the SACK option field can be used to report
the sequence numbers of the packet that triggered the acknowledgement.
This extension to the SACK option allows the TCP sender to infer the
order of packets received at the receiver, allowing the sender to infer
when it has unnecessarily retransmitted a packet. A TCP sender could
then use this information for more robust operation in an environment of
reordered packets [BPS99], ACK loss, packet replication, and/or early

defined by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information

document contains protocol identifier macros for well-known protocols. A
conformant implementation of the RMON-2 MIB can be accomplished without
the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this document
does not specify any IETF standard. It is published to encourage better
interoperability between RMON-2 agent implementations, by providing a
great deal of RMON related protocol information in one document. The
first version of the RMON Protocol Identifiers Document has been split
into a standards-track Reference portion, and an {"}RMON Protocol

change control is retained within the PKCS process. The body of this

directly from that specification. This document provides recommendations
for the implementation of password-based cryptography, covering key
derivation functions, encryption schemes, message-authentication
schemes, and ASN.1 syntax identifying the techniques. The
recommendations are intended for general application within computer and
communications systems, and as such include a fair amount of
flexibility. They are particularly intended for the protection of
sensitive information such as private keys, as in PKCS #8. It is
expected that application standards and implementation profiles based on
these specifications may include additional constraints. Other
cryptographic techniques based on passwords, such as password- based key
entity authentication and key establishment protocols are outside the
scope of this document. Guidelines for the selection of passwords are
also outside the scope.",

direction is straightforward if the attributes are restricted to use
just a few of the syntaxes defined in RFC 2252. If arbitrary ASN.1 types
occur in the schema, then the mapping is more complex and may even be
impossible. The second aspect is representation of service information
in an LDAP directory. The recommended representation simplifies
interoperability with SLP by allowing SLP directory agents to backend
into LDAP directory servers. The resulting system allows service

protocol messages are identified by the 'DHCP Message Type' option
(option code 51). Each message type is defined by the data value carried
in the 'DHCP Message Type' option. New DHCP options and message types
may be defined after the publication of the DHCP specification to

meshes of (loosely) affiliated referral indexes. The purpose of such a
mesh of servers is to implement some kind of distributed sharing of
indexing and/or searching tasks across different servers. So far, the
TISDAG (Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways)
project ([TISDAG], [DAGEXP]) has focused on creating a single referral
index; the obvious next step is to integrate that into a larger set of

Telia in cooperation with Nortel Networks. SPIRITS-like services are
those originating in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and
necessitating the interactions of the Internet and PSTN. Surveying the
implementations, we can make the following observations: The ICW service
plays the role of a benchmark service. All four implementations can
support ICW, with three specifically designed for it. Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) is used in most of the implementations as the base
communications protocol between the PSTN and Internet. (NEC's
implementation is the only exception that uses a proprietary protocol.
Nevertheless, NEC has a plan to support SIP together with the extensions
for SPIRITS services.) All implementations use IN-based solutions for
the PSTN part. It is clear that not all pre-SPIRITS implementations
inter-operate with each other. It is also clear that not all SIP-based
implementations inter-operate with each other given that they do not
support the same version of SIP. It is a task of the SPIRITS Working

PAGES=12,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=nov,
YEAR=2000,
ABSTRACT="In the typical Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)/Intserv
model, applications request a specific Intserv service type and quantify
the resources required for that service. For certain applications, the
determination of service parameters is best left to the discretion of
the network administrator. For example, ERP applications are often
mission critical and require some form of prioritized service, but
cannot readily specify their resource requirements. To serve such
applications, we introduce the notion of the \'Null Service'. The Null
Service allows applications to identify themselves to network Quality of
Service (QoS) policy agents, using RSVP signaling. However, it does not
require them to specify resource requirements. QoS policy agents in the
network respond by applying QoS policies appropriate for the application
(as determined by the network administrator). This mode of RSVP usage is
particularly applicable to networks that combine differentiated service
(diffserv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling [intdiff]. In this
environment, QoS policy agents may direct the signaled application's
traffic to a particular diffserv class of service. This document is a

PAGES=13,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=nov,

ABSTRACT="An Integrated Services (int-serv) router performs admission
control and resource allocation based on the information contained in a
TSpec (among other things). As currently defined, TSpecs convey
information about the data rate (using a token bucket) and range of
packet sizes of the flow in question. However, the TSpec may not be an
accurate representation of the resources needed to support the
reservation if the router is able to compress the data at the link
level. This specification describes an extension to the TSpec which
enables a sender of potentially compressible data to provide hints to
int-serv routers about the compressibility they may obtain. Routers
which support appropriate compression take advantage of the hint in
their admission control decisions and resource allocation procedures;
other routers ignore the hint. An initial application of this approach
is to notify routers performing real-time transport protocol (RTP)
header compression that they may allocate fewer resources to RTP flows.

ABSTRACT="This document is a self-contained specification of the basic
protocol for the Internet electronic mail transport. It consolidates,
updates and clarifies, but doesn't add new or change existing
functionality of the following: the original SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol) specification of RFC 821, domain name system requirements and
implications for mail transport from RFC 1035 and RFC 974, the
clarifications and applicability statements in RFC 1123, and material
drawn from the SMTP Extension mechanisms. It obsoletes RFC 821, RFC 974,
and updates RFC 1123 (replaces the mail transport materials of RFC
1123). However, RFC 821 specifies some features that were not in
significant use in the Internet by the mid-1990s and (in appendices)
some additional transport models. Those sections are omitted here in the
interest of clarity and brevity; readers needing them should refer to
RFC 821. It also includes some additional material from RFC 1123 that
required amplification. This material has been identified in multiple
ways, mostly by tracking flaming on various lists and newsgroups and
problems of unusual readings or interpretations that have appeared as
the SMTP extensions have been deployed. Where this specification moves
beyond consolidation and actually differs from earlier documents, it
supersedes them technically as well as textually. Although SMTP was
designed as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification
also contains information that is important to its use as a 'mail
submission' protocol, as recommended for POP and IMAP. Additional
submission issues are discussed in RFC 2476. Section 2.3 provides
definitions of terms specific to this document. Except when the
historical terminology is necessary for clarity, this document uses the
current 'client' and 'server' terminology to identify the sending and
receiving SMTP processes, respectively. A companion document discusses
message headers, message bodies and formats and structures for them, and
their relationship. This document is a product of the Detailed

ABSTRACT="Software that handles electronic mailing list messages

headers, it has become even more important to provide a unique
identifier for a mailing list regardless of the particular host that
serves as the list processor at any given time. The List-Id header
provides a standard location for such an identifier. In addition, a
namespace for list identifiers based on fully qualified domain names is
described. This namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list
owners who require it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace for
experimental and personal use. By including the List-Id field, list
servers can make it easier for mail clients to provide automated tools
for users to perform list functions. The list identifier can serve as a
key to make many automated processing tasks easier, and hence more

ABSTRACT="Mobile Internet Protocol (IP) uses tunneling from the home

ABSTRACT="Many internet applications can be adversely affected when end
nodes are not in the same address realm and seek the assistance of an IP
Network Address Translator (NAT) enroute to bridge the realms. The NAT
device alone cannot provide the necessary application/protocol
transparency in all cases and seeks the assistance of Application Level
Gateways (ALGs) where possible, to provide transparency. The purpose of
this document is to identify the protocols and applications that break
with NAT enroute. The document also attempts to identify any known
workarounds. It is not possible to capture all applications that break
with NAT in a single document. This document attempts to capture as much
information as possible, but is by no means a comprehensive coverage. We
hope the coverage provides sufficient clues for applications not
covered. This document is a product of the Network Address Translators

ABSTRACT={{"}Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS){"} requires a set of

encoding technique which, given a label stack and a network layer
packet, produces a labeled packet. This document specifies the encoding
to be used by an LSR in order to transmit labeled packets on
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) data links, on LAN data links, and
possibly on other data links as well. On some data links, the label at
the top of the stack may be encoded in a different manner, but the
techniques described here MUST be used to encode the remainder of the
label stack. This document also specifies rules and procedures for
processing the various fields of the label stack encoding. This document

ABSTRACT="The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Architecture

routing algorithms (such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),
Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), etc.), and their
data forwarding is based on the results of these routing algorithms. No
ATM-specific routing or addressing is needed. ATM switches used in this
way are known as ATM-LSRs (Label Switching Routers). This document
extends and clarifies the relevant portions of RFC 3031 and RFC 3036 by
specifying in more detail the procedures which to be used when
distributing labels to or from ATM-LSRs, when those labels represent
Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs, see RFC 3031) for which the routes
are determined on a hop-by-hop basis by network layer routing
algorithms. This document also specifies the MPLS encapsulation to be

PAGES=17,

ABSTRACT="Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate
addresses without the necessity of a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

an interface identifier. On interfaces that contain embedded IEEE
Identifiers, the interface identifier is typically derived from it. On
other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through
other means, for example, via random number generation. This document
describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for
interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE
identifier. Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global-scope
addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in
cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier. Changing
the interface identifier (and the global-scope addresses generated from
it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other
information collectors to identify when different addresses used in
different transactions actually correspond to the same node. This

response to each of the first two duplicate acknowledgments that arrive

that TCP can recover from a single lost segment using the fast
retransmit algorithm, rather than using a costly retransmission timeout.
Limited Transmit can be used both in conjunction with, and in the
absence of, the TCP selective acknowledgment (SACK) mechanism. This

MONTH=jan,
YEAR=2001,
ABSTRACT={Newer high-speed public Internet access technologies call for
a high-speed modem to have a local area network (LAN) attachment to one
or more customer premise hosts. It is advantageous to use the Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as defined in RFC 2131 to assign
customer premise host IP addresses in this environment. However, a
number of security and scaling problems arise with such {"}public{"} DHCP
use. This document describes a new DHCP option to address these issues.
This option extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132. The
new option is called the Relay Agent Information option and is inserted
by the DHCP relay agent when forwarding client-originated DHCP packets
to a DHCP server. Servers recognizing the Relay Agent Information option
may use the information to implement IP address or other parameter
assignment policies. The DHCP Server echoes the option back verbatim to
the relay agent in server-to-client replies, and the relay agent strips
the option before forwarding the reply to the client. The {"}Relay Agent
Information{"} option is organized as a single DHCP option that contains
one or more {"}sub-options{"} that convey information known by the relay
agent. The initial sub-options are defined for a relay agent that is
co-located in a public circuit access unit. These include a {"}circuit
ID{"}
for the incoming circuit, and a {"}remote ID{"} which provides a trusted
identifier for the remote high-speed modem. This document is a product

ABSTRACT="This memo specifies an optional interim mechanism for IPv6
sites to communicate with each other over the IPv4 network without
explicit tunnel setup, and for them to communicate with native IPv6
domains via relay routers. Effectively it treats the wide area IPv4
network as a unicast point-to-point link layer. The mechanism is
intended as a start-up transition tool used during the period of
co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6. It is not intended as a permanent
solution. The document defines a method for assigning an interim unique
IPv6 address prefix to any site that currently has at least one globally
unique IPv4 address, and specifies an encapsulation mechanism for
transmitting IPv6 packets using such a prefix over the global IPv4
network. The motivation for this method is to allow isolated IPv6
domains or hosts, attached to an IPv4 network which has no native IPv6
support, to communicate with other such IPv6 domains or hosts with
minimal manual configuration, before they can obtain natuve IPv6
connectivity. It incidentally provides an interim globally unique IPv6
address prefix to any site with at least one globally unique IPv4
address, even if combined with an IPv4 Network Address Translator (NAT).

PAGES=10,

MONTH=feb,
YEAR=2001,
ABSTRACT={RFC 1591, {"}Domain Name System Structure and Delegation{"}, laid
out the basic administrative design and principles for the allocation
and administration of domains, from the top level down. It was written
before the introduction of the world wide web (WWW) and rapid growth of
the Internet put significant market, social, and political pressure on
domain name allocations. In recent years, 1591 has been cited by all
sides in various debates, and attempts have been made by various bodies
to update it or adjust its provisions, sometimes under pressures that
have arguably produced policies that are less well thought out than the
original. Some of those efforts have begun from misconceptions about the
provisions of 1591 or the motivation for those provisions. The current
directions of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN) and other groups who now determine the Domain Name System (DNS)
policy directions appear to be drifting away from the policies and
philosophy of 1591. This document is being published primarily for
historical context and comparative purposes, essentially to document
some thoughts about how 1591 might have been interpreted and adjusted by
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and ICANN to better
reflect today's world while retaining characteristics and policies that
have proven to be effective in supporting Internet growth and stability.
An earlier variation of this memo was submitted to ICANN as a comment on
its evolving Top-level Domain (TLD) policies.},

condition (e.g., policing and shaping) traffic according to the rules.
Short-term changes in the QoS goals for a DS domain are implemented by
changing only the configuration of these edge behaviors without
necessarily reconfiguring the behavior of interior network nodes. The
next step is to formulate examples of how forwarding path components
(PHBs, classifiers, and traffic conditioners) can be used to compose
traffic aggregates whose packets experience specific forwarding
characteristics as they transit a differentiated services domain. The WG
has decided to use the term per-domain behavior, or PDB, to describe the
behavior experienced by a particular set of packets as they cross a DS
domain. A PDB is characterized by specific metrics that quantify the
treatment a set of packets with a particular DSCP (or set of DSCPs) will
receive as it crosses a DS domain. A PDB specifies a forwarding path
treatment for a traffic aggregate and, due to the role that particular
choices of edge and PHB configuration play in its resulting attributes,
it is where the forwarding path and the control plane interact. The
measurable parameters of a PDB should be suitable for use in Service
Level Specifications at the network edge. This document defines and
discusses Per-Domain Behaviors in detail and lays out the format and
required content for contributions to the Diffserv WG on PDBs and the
procedure that will be applied for individual PDB specifications to
advance as WG products. This format is specified to expedite working
group review of PDB submissions. This document is a product of the
Differentiated Services Working Group of the IETF.},

ABSTRACT="This memo provides information for the Internet community. It
describes a useful way to conceptualize the use of the standard SIP
(Session Initiation Protocol) Request-URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
that the authors and many members of the SIP community think is suitable
as a convention. It does not define any new protocol with respect to RFC
2543. In a conventional telephony environment, extended service
applications often use call state information, such as calling party,
called party, reason for forward, etc, to infer application context. In
a SIP/2.0 call, much of this information may be either non-existent or
unreliable. This document proposes a mechanism to communicate context
information to an application. Under this proposal, a client or proxy
can communicate context through the use of a distinctive Request-URI.
This document continues with examples of how this mechanism could be
used in a voice mail application.",

ABSTRACT="Internet Transparency via the end-to-end architecture of the
Internet has allowed vast innovation of new technologies and services
[1]. However, recent developments in Firewall technology have altered
this model and have been shown to inhibit innovation. We propose the
Firewall Enhancement Protocol (FEP) to allow innovation, without
violating the security model of a Firewall. With no cooperation from a
firewall operator, the FEP allows ANY application to traverse a
Firewall. Our methodology is to layer any application layer Transmission
Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) packets over the
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol, since HTTP packets are
typically able to transit Firewalls. This scheme does not violate the
actual security usefulness of a Firewall, since Firewalls are designed
to thwart attacks from the outside and to ignore threats from within.
The use of FEP is compatible with the current Firewall security model
because it requires cooperation from a host inside the Firewall. FEP
allows the best of both worlds: the security of a firewall, and
transparent tunneling thought the firewall.",

TITLE="Electronic Signature Policies",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=3125,
PAGES=44,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=sep,
YEAR=2001,
ABSTRACT="This document defines signature policies for electronic
signatures. A signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and
validation of an electronic signature, under which the validity of
signature can be determined. A given legal/contractual context may
recognize a particular signature policy as meeting its requirements. A
signature policy has a globally unique reference, which is bound to an
electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature calculation.
The signature policy needs to be available in human readable form so
that it can be assessed to meet the requirements of the legal and
contractual context in which it is being applied. To allow for the
automatic processing of an electronic signature another part of the
signature policy specifies the electronic rules for the creation and
validation of the electronic signature in a computer processable form.
In the current document the format of the signature policy is defined
using ASN.1. The contents of this document is based on the signature
policy defined in ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.2.2 (2000-12) Copyright (C).

ABSTRACT="This document defines the format of an electronic signature
that can remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to
its validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to
deny (i.e., repudiates the validity of the signature). The format can be
considered as an extension to RFC 2630 and RFC 2634, where, when
appropriate additional signed and unsigned attributes have been defined.

Since the flow along an LSP is completely identified by the label

tunnels. A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering with
MPLS as specified in RFC 2702. We propose several additional objects

tables for ATM switch LSRs that use downstream-on-demand mode, one
method can be used for non-vc merge capable ATM LSRs, while the other
one can be used for the vc-merge capable ATM LSRs. In section 3, we
provides a state machine for downstream unsolicited mode ATM LSRs. We
focus on the LDP state machines and the associated control blocks used
for establishing and maintaining LSPs. We do not describe state machines
for the {"}LDP controller{"} that is in charge of LDP session
initialization, address mapping messages management, routing interface,

faced serious questions regarding RFC 2598 - the group's standards track
definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB). An
'EF Design Team' volunteered to develop a re-expression of RFC 2598,
bearing in mind the issues raised in the DiffServ group. At the San

ABSTRACT={Mostly Pointless Lamp Switching (MPLampS) is an architecture

to our marketing department, MPLampS has the potential to dramatically

such work as SONET/SDH over IP/MPLS (with apologies to the authors).
Readers of the previous work have been observed scratching their heads
and muttering, {"}What next?{"}. This document answers that question. This
document has also been written as a public service. The {"}Sub-IP{"} area
has been formed to give equal opportunity to those working on
technologies outside of traditional IP networking to write complicated
IETF documents. There are possibly many who are wondering how to exploit
this opportunity and attain high visibility. Towards this goal, we see
the topics of {"}foo-over-MPLS{"} (or MPLS control for random technologies)
as highly amenable for producing a countless number of unimplementable
documents. This document illustrates the key ingredients that go into
producing any {"}foo-over-MPLS{"} document and may be used as a template

{"}Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting InTernet Service{"}.) The purpose of
the protocol is to support services that originate in the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions
between the PSTN and the Internet. Similarly, such services are called
SPIRITS services. (Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery,
and Internet Call Forwarding are examples of SPIRIT services, but the
protocol is to define the building blocks from which many other services
can be built.) On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are initiated from
the Intelligent Network (IN) entities; the earlier IETF work on the
PSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted in the protocol (RFC 2848) in
support of the services initiated the other way around--from the
Internet to PSTN. To this end, this document lists general requirements
for the SPIRITS protocol as well as those pertinent to IN, Wireless IN,
and PINT building blocks. The document also presents the SPIRITS WG

Middleboxes implementing Firewall and Network Address Translator
services typically embed application intelligence within the device for
their operation. The document specifies an architecture and framework in
which trusted third parties can be delegated to assist the middleboxes
to perform their operation, without resorting to embedding application

ABSTRACT={People often refer to things in the real world by a common
name or phrase, e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. These
names are sometimes easier for people to remember and type than URLs.
Furthermore, because of the limited syntax of URLs, companies and
individuals are finding that the ones that might be most reasonable for
their resources are being used elsewhere and so are unavailable. For the
purposes of this document, a {"}common name{"} is a word or a phrase,
without imposed syntactic structure, that may be associated with a
resource. This effort is about the creation of a protocol for client
applications to communicate with common name resolution services, as
exemplified in both the browser enhancement and search site paradigms.
Although the protocol's primary function is resolution, it is also
intended to address issues of internationalization and localization.
Name resolution services are not generic search services and thus do not
need to provide complex Boolean query, relevance ranking or similar
capabilities. The protocol is a simple, minimal interoperable core.
Mechanisms for extension are provided, so that additional capabilities
can be added. This document is a product of the Common Name Resolution

PAGES=14,

ABSTRACT={In IP access networks that support host mobility, the routing
paths between the host and the network may change frequently and
rapidly. In some cases, the host may establish certain context transfer
candidate services on subnets that are left behind when the host moves.
Examples of such services are Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting (AAA), header compression, and Quality of Service (QoS). In
order for the host to obtain those services on the new subnet, the host
must explicitly re-establish the service by performing the necessary
signaling flows from scratch. In some cases, this process would
considerably slow the process of establishing the mobile host on the new
subnet. An alternative is to transfer information on the existing state
associated with these services, or context, to the new subnet, a process
called {"}context transfer{"}. This document discusses the desirability of
context transfer for facilitating seamless IP mobility.},

PAGES=25,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=dec,
YEAR=2002,
ABSTRACT="The Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type, like the
Multipart/Related content-type, provides a mechanism for representing
objects that consist of multiple components. An
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity contains a sequence of chunks.
Each chunk contains a MIME message or a part of a MIME message. Each
MIME message represents a component of the compound object, just as a
body part of a Multipart/Related entity represents a component. With a
Multipart/Related entity, a body part and its reference in some other
body part may be separated by many octets. With an
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity, a message and its reference in
some other message can be made quite close by chunking the message
containing the reference. For example, if a long message contains
references to images and the producer does not know of the need for each
image until it generates the reference, then
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed allows the consumer to process the
reference to the image and the image before it consumes the entire long
message. This ability is important in printing and scanning
applications. This document defines the Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed
content-type. It also provides examples of its use.",

MESSAGE request is an extension to SIP, it inherits all the request
routing and security features of that protocol. MESSAGE requests carry
the content in the form of MIME body parts. MESSAGE requests do not
themselves initiate a SIP dialog; under normal usage each Instant
Message stands alone, much like pager messages. MESSAGE requests may be
sent in the context of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request.

ABSTRACT="This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling

knowledge about the media that is in use. When the L2TP is used, the two
PPP peers are no longer directly connected over the same physical media.
Instead, L2TP inserts a virtual connection over some or all of the PPP
connection by tunneling PPP frames over a packet switched network such
as IP. Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may need to negotiate PPP
Link Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location which may not have
access to all of the media information necessary for proper
participation in the LCP negotiation. This document provides a mechanism
for communicating desired LCP options between L2TP endpoints in advance
of PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an L2TP tunnel, as well as a
mechanism for communicating the negotiated LCP options back to where the

ABSTRACT="This document describes TCP performance problems that arise
because of asymmetric effects. These problems arise in several access
networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio
subnetworks, for different underlying reasons. However, the end result
on TCP performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades
significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK
feedback from the receiver to the sender. The document details several
mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or
evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks.
These solutions use a combination of local link-layer techniques,
subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to
manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the
ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency of
TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain
the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self-clocking and (iii)
techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction
to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic. Each
technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations
for use. A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the

ABSTRACT="As the deployment of second and third generation cellular networks
progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to
the Internet.  Standardization organizations are making Internet
Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.  However,
the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous specifications.
In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of
bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is
used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to
the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  This document also lists
basic components of IPv6 functionality and discusses some issues
relating to the use of these components when operating in these
networks.

ABSTRACT="This document defines a set of PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) and textual
conventions that are common to all clients that provision policy using
Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol for Provisioning.

Structure of Policy Provisioning Information (SPPI) describes a
structure for specifying policy information that can then be
transmitted to a network device for the purpose of configuring
policy at that device.  The model underlying this structure is one
of well-defined (PRCs) and instances of these
classes (PRIs) residing in a virtual information store called the
Policy Information Base (PIB).

One way to provision policy is by means of the (COPS) protocol with
the extensions for provisioning.  This protocol supports multiple
clients, each of which may provision policy for a specific policy
domain such as QoS, virtual private networks, or security.

As described in COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), each
client supports a non-overlapping and independent set of PIB
modules.  However, some PRovisioning Classes are common to all
subject-categories (client-types) and need to be present in
each.

ABSTRACT={This document describes an application programming interface and a

Media gateways contain endpoints on which the Call Agent can create,

media sessions with other multimedia endpoints.  Also, the Call Agent
can instruct the endpoints to detect certain events and generate
signals.  The endpoints automatically communicate changes in service
state to the Call Agent.  Furthermore, the Call Agent can audit
endpoints as well as the connections on endpoints.

The basic and general MGCP protocol is defined in this document,
however most media gateways will need to implement one or more MGCP
packages, which define extensions to the protocol suitable for use
with specific types of media gateways.  Such packages are defined in

By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a
content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when
providing gateway services to systems of lesser
capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide
what parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try
to deliver a body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts
that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser
capability receives a message.  In addition, critical content can
help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving
system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do
some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender
to mark body parts that the receiver must process.

ABSTRACT="Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping
forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable
service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of
the traffic carried on different paths.  This requires that the label
switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification,
and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the
configuration of recovery.  With these objectives in mind, this
document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.  Restart
issues are not included in this framework.

TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=3478,
PAGES=12,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=feb,
YEAR=2003,
ABSTRACT="This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the
negative effects on MPLS traffic caused by Label Switching Router's
(LSR's) control plane restart, specifically by the restart of its
Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) component, on LSRs that are capable
of preserving the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.

The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LSRs,
both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP
restart and those without (although the latter needs to implement only
a subset of the mechanism described in this document).  Supporting (a
subset of) the mechanism described here by the LSRs that can not
preserve their MPLS forwarding state across the restart would not
reduce the negative impact on MPLS traffic caused by their control
plane restart, but it would minimize the impact if their neighbor(s)
are capable of preserving the forwarding state across the restart of
their control plane and implement the mechanism described here.

The mechanism makes minimalistic assumptions on what has to be
preserved across restart - the mechanism assumes that only the actual
MPLS forwarding state has to be preserved; the mechanism does not
require any of the LDP-related states to be preserved across the
restart.

The procedures described in this document apply to downstream
unsolicited label distribution.  Extending these procedures to
downstream on demand label distribution is for further study.

in the LDP specification in RFC 3036, {"}LDP Specification{"},
that make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the
current LDP protocols, and defines enhancements to the
LDP specification to ease such FT LSR implementations.

ABSTRACT="This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number

NP is a regulatory imperative seeking to liberalize local
telephony service competition, by enabling end-users to retain
telephone numbers while changing service providers.  NP changes the
fundamental nature of a dialed E.164 number from a hierarchical
physical routing address to a virtual address, thereby requiring the
transparent translation of the later to the former.  In addition,
there are various regulatory constraints that establish relevant
parameters for NP implementation, most of which are not network
technology specific.  Consequently, the implementation of NP
behavior consistent with applicable regulatory constraints, as well
as the need for interoperation with the existing GSTN NP
implementations, are relevant topics for numerous areas of IP
telephony works-in-progress with the IETF.

socket address structure to carry IPv6 addresses, new address
conversion functions, and some new socket options.  These extensions
are designed to provide access to the basic IPv6 features required by

ABSTRACT="The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows
a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a
server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message
folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.
IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to
resynchronize with the server.

IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,
setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing,
searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and
portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of
numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique
identifiers.

IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing
configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is
discussed in RFC 2244.

IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821.",

ABSTRACT="The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
Internet environment.

This document replaces RFC 3010 as the definition of the NFS version 4
protocol.

Block",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=3531,
MONTH=apr,
YEAR=2003,
ABSTRACT="This document proposes a method to manage the assignment of bits of an IPv6
address block or range. When an organisation needs to make an address plan
for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an address plan for its
customers, this method enables the organisation to postpone the final
decision on the number of bits to partition in the address space they have.
It does it by keeping the bits around the borders of the partition to be
free as long as possible. This scheme is applicable to any bits addressing
scheme using bits with partitions in the space, but its first intended use
is for IPv6. It is a generalization of RFC 1219 and can be used for IPv6
assignments.",

Compressed Real-time Transport Protocol (CRTP), the IP/UDP/RTP
header compression described in RFC 2508.  CRTP does not perform well
on such links: packet loss results in context corruption and due to
the long delay, many more packets are discarded before the context
is repaired.  To correct the behavior of CRTP over such links, a few
extensions to the protocol are specified here.  The extensions aim to
reduce context corruption by changing the way the compressor updates
the context at the decompressor: updates are repeated and include
updates to full and differential context parameters.  With these
extensions, CRTP performs well over links with packet loss, packet
reordering and long delays.

INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=3550,
PAGES=104,
DAYS=15,
MONTH=jul,
YEAR=2003,
ABSTRACT="This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP
provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for
applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or
simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP
does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee
quality-of-service for real-time services.  The data transport is
augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the
data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and
to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and
RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and
network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level
translators and mixers.

Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it
obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire,
only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol
is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer
algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to
minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many
participants join a session simultaneously.

ABSTRACT="This document describes the authentication of Intermediate System to
Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the
Hashed Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5)
algorithm as found in RFC 2104.  IS-IS is specified in International
Standards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base
specification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for
multiple authentication algorithms.  The base specification only
specifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords.

This document proposes an extension to that specification that
allows the use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in
conjunction with the existing authentication mechanisms.

ABSTRACT="The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines a mechanism for
tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sessions.  It is common for
these PPP sessions to be established using modems connected over the
public switched telephone network.

One of the standards governing modem operation defines procedures
that enable a client modem to put the call on hold and later, re-
establish the modem link with minimal delay and without having to
redial.  While the modem call is on hold, the client phone line can
be used to place or receive other calls.

The L2TP base protocol does not provide any means to signal these
events from the L2TP Access Controller (LAC), where the modem is
physically connected, to the L2TP Network Server (LNS), where the PPP
session is handled.

This document describes a method to let the LNS know when a client
modem connected to a LAC has placed the call on hold.

TITLE="Optimized Link State Routing Protocol {(OLSR)}",
TYPE="RFC",
INSTITUTION="Internet Engineering Task Force",
NUMBER=3626,
MONTH=oct,
YEAR=2003,
ABSTRACT="This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol
for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the
classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile
wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint
relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages
during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the
message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every
node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the
message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected
as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number
of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR
node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.
Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state
information is distributed in the network. This information is then used
for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of
hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks
as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.",

ABSTRACT="The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) for IPv4 and the
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2) for IPv6 add the capability for
applications to express source filters on multicast group memberships,
which allows receiver applications to determine the set of senders

also simplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications.

This document specifies new socket options and functions to manage
source filters for IP Multicast group memberships.  It also defines
the socket structures to provide input and output arguments to these
new application program interfaces (APIs).  These extensions are
designed to provide access to the source filtering features, while
introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete
compatibility for existing multicast applications.

Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is most effective in protecting
directly connected protocol peers, it can also provide a lower level of
protection to multi-hop sessions. GTSM is not directly applicable to
protocols employing flooding mechanisms (e.g., multicast), and use of
multi-hop GTSM should be considered on a case-by-case basis.",

NUMBER=3684,
MONTH=feb,
YEAR=2004,
ABSTRACT="Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a
proactive, link-state routing protocol designed for mobile ad-hoc networks,
which provides hop-by-hop routing along shortest paths to each destination.
Each node running TBRPF computes a source tree (providing paths to all
reachable nodes) based on partial topology information stored in its
topology table, using a modification of Dijkstra's algorithm. To minimize
overhead, each node reports only *part* of its source tree to neighbors.
TBRPF uses a combination of periodic and differential updates to keep all
neighbors informed of the reported part of its source tree. Each node also
has the option to report additional topology information (up to the full
topology), to provide improved robustness in highly mobile networks. TBRPF
performs neighbor discovery using differential HELLO messages which report
only *changes* in the status of neighbors. This results in HELLO messages
that are much smaller than those of other link-state routing protocols such
as OSPF.",

ABSTRACT="This document describes known incompatibilities between Network Address
Translation (NAT) and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing
them. Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private
networking capabilities. One very popular use of Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs) is to provide telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet. Today,
NATs are widely deployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations
likely to be used by telecommuters, such as hotels. The result is that
IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier in the deployment
of IPsec in one of its principal uses.",

ABSTRACT="This document specifies Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC), which
provides rate and congestion control for data delivery. WEBRC is
specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast. It provides
multiple-rate, congestion-controlled delivery to receivers, i.e., different
receivers joined to the same session may be receiving packets at different
rates depending on the bandwidths of their individual connections to the
sender and on competing traffic along these connections. WEBRC requires no
feedback from receivers to the sender, i.e., it is a completely
receiver-driven congestion control protocol. Thus, it is designed to scale
to potentially massive numbers of receivers attached to a session from a
single sender. Furthermore, because each individual receiver adjusts to the
available bandwidth between the sender and that receiver, there is the
potential to deliver data to each individual receiver at the fastest
possible rate for that receiver, even in a highly heterogeneous network
architecture, using a single sender.",

ABSTRACT="This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for
use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. For TCP connections
that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands)
of MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the
current slow-start procedure can result in increasing the congestion window
by thousands of segments in a single round-trip time. Such an increase can
easily result in thousands of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.
This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard
on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested link. This note describes
Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number of
segments by which the congestion window is increased for one window of data
during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCP connections with
large congestion windows.",

ABSTRACT="This document specifies a protocol which allows nodes to remain

   provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6
   packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently
   routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to
   cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of
   address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node
   directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation,
   Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.All

ABSTRACT="IPsec can secure the links of a multihop network to protect communication
between trusted components, e.g., for a secure virtual network (VN),
overlay, or virtual private network (VPN). Virtual links established by
IPsec tunnel mode can conflict with routing and forwarding inside VNs
because IP routing depends on references to interfaces and next-hop IP
addresses. The IPsec tunnel mode specification is ambiguous on this issue,
so even compliant implementations cannot be trusted to avoid conflicts. An
alternative to tunnel mode uses non-IPsec IPIP encapsulation together with
IPsec transport mode, which we call IIPtran. IPIP encapsulation occurs as a
separate initial step, as the result of a forwarding lookup of the VN
packet. IPsec transport mode processes the resulting (tunneled) IP packet
with an SA determined through a security association database (SAD) match
on the tunnel header. IIPtran supports dynamic routing",

services. NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for
transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow
for operation with minimal a priori coordination among senders and
receivers. A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM
protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport
protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is capable of
operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and
receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path)
between the senders and receivers. The protocol offers a number of features
to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher level
transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways. The protocol
leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable multicast

specifies that data exchanged via the record protocol will not be
compressed.  This document describes an additional compression method
associated with the Lempel-Ziv-Stac (LZS) lossless data compression
algorithm for use with TLS.  This document also defines the
application of the LZS algorithm to the TLS Record Protocol.",

ABSTRACT="A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource. This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines
a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation
to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the
scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This
specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is
performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.",

ABSTRACT="This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements, and
captures design aspects for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 (L7) Location Configuration
Protocol (LCP).  This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location
information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server
(LIS) that is located in the access network.  The obtained location
information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and
purposes.  For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service
Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location within the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities.",

ABSTRACT="Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become popular for certain applications
and deployments for a variety of reasons, including fault tolerance,
economics, and legal issues.  It has therefore become reasonable for
resource consuming and typically centralized applications like Voice over
IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication to adapt and exploit the
benefits of P2P.  Such a migration needs to address a new set of
P2P-specific security problems.  This document describes some of the known
issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues
and the applicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures
for realtime communication.  This document is a product of the P2P Research
Group.",

ABSTRACT={In this specification, we define a framework to group {"}m{"} lines in the
Session Description Protocol (SDP) for different purposes.  This framework
uses the {"}group{"} and {"}mid{"} SDP attributes, both of which are
defined in this specification.  Additionally, we specify how to use the
framework for two different purposes: for lip synchronization and for
receiving a media flow consisting of several media streams on different
transport addresses.  This document obsoletes RFC 3388.},

ABSTRACT={This document specifies protocol stacks for the routing and transport of
per-flow signalling messages along the path taken by that flow through the
network.  The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a
common messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST),
which provides a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST
does not handle signalling application state itself, but manages its own
internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and
security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions
along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport
and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component
of the {"}Next Steps in Signalling{"} (NSIS) framework.},

NUMBER=5979,

ABSTRACT="NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform QoS
reservation along a data flow path.  When the data flow path contains IP
tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel
segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel segments could become the
weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS efforts in the rest of the
end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS signaling within the tunnel is
caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original IP header
fields.  Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS
signaling messages and classify QoS data packets.  This document defines a
solution to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to
corresponding QoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS
signaling into the IP tunnel segments.",
