\begin{dedication}
This dissertation is dedicated first and foremost to my wife, who dealt with me, bills, kept our children fed and otherwise kept a roof over my head while I was preoccupied with writing this dissertation.  She took care of everything while working full time in Santa Fe and enabling my higher education addiction.  I could never have accomplished this without her support, love, and encouragement.  She was key in keeping me on some kind of schedule to finish.  Without her gentle reminders regarding the importance of actually {\bf completing} my dissertation, I would likely be submitting this some time in 2014.

This is dedicated to you Missy.

\begin{acknowledgments}
   \vspace{1.1in}
I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Greg Heileman, for reading and re-reading my papers and dissertation, and guiding my research.  Truly widely educated with a deep understanding of an astounding number of fields, his guidance and suggestions were invaluable in helping me craft this dissertation.

Thanks to my committee for sitting through my defence, reading this dissertation, and supporting me as well as the larger computer science  and computer engineering disciplines at the University of New Mexico (UNM).  We indeed have world-class academics here at UNM, and I was so very lucky to have some of them working with me, teaching me, and helping me with my research over the (many) years.
   
I would also like to thank everyone in the Informatics Lab.  Their feedback, support, and encouragement was so very helpful in my completion of this dissertation.  Especially Pramod Jamkhedkar, my long time collaborator, and Sinan al-Saffar.  It's especially inspiring when you see someone you work with actually complete a Ph.D program.

\begin{abstract}
Information-centric networks have distinct advantages with regard to securing sensitive content as a result of their new approaches to managing data in potential future internet architectures.  These kinds of systems, because of their data-centric perspective, provide the opportunity to embed  policy-centric content management components that can address looming problems in information distribution that both companies and federal agencies are beginning to face with respect to sensitive content.  This work addresses the current state of the art in both these kinds of cross-domain systems and information-centric networking in general.  It then covers other related work, outlining why information-centric networks are more powerful with regard to usage management.  Then, it introduces a taxonomy of types of policy-centric usage managed information-centric network systems and an associated methodology for evaluating the individual taxonomic elements.  It finally delves into experimental evaluation of the various defined architectural options and presents results of comparing experimental evaluation with anticipated outcomes. This work is the end result of four conference papers (IEEE Cloud 2011, ACM DRM 2011, IEEE SoSE '11, and IEEE Cloud 2012), one invited talk (DoDIS 2012), and research performed using this system is currently submitted to two journals for publication (IJ-Closer and Dynamic Work).

\item[CCN] Content-Centric Network
\item[content network] A network used to store information in which a single query to a contained content node will propagate that query to other systems until a suitable response is found.
\item[content node] A single system in a content network.
\item[content router] An node in a content network that routes queries to child nodes.  Content routers do not contain data, but just route queries.
\item[context] The environment in which a resource is used by a subject.
\item[context manager] A component that manages information associated with a context.
\item[cross domain] Actions that span two or more domains.
\item[cross domain solution] A product that facilitates interoperability between two domains.
\item[DONA] Data-Oriented Network Architecture
\item[domain (security domain)] A group of systems designed to handle certain specific types of information.
\item[domain ontology] An ontology of data from a specific domain.
\item[enclave] A subset of systems within a domain.
\item[filter] A component generally in a guard that examines a set of data and reacts specific elements of that set according to predetermined rules.
\item[guard] A system between two domains that validates information crossing from one domain to the other as appropriate for storage in the destination domain.
\item[hierarchical content network] A content network organized in a strict hierarchy.
\item[ICN] Information-Centric Network
\item[NetInf] Network of Information
\item[non-hierarchical content network] A content network that is not organized hierarchically.  An example would be a peer-to-peer system.
\item[ontology manager] A component that manages and unifies domain ontologies from different domains.
\item[ontology compiler] A component that compiles an RDF/XML ontology into Ruby.
\item[ontological hierarchy] A hierarchy of ontologies.  Generally associated with policy ontologies.
\item[overlay network] A network of nodes that communicate using the application layer of the TCP/IP or OSI network communication models.
\item[policy] A set of rules that determine how associated content can be used.
\item[policy ontology] The ontology of security policy classifiers in a specific domain.
\item[policy set] A set of policies or policy sets.
\item[PSIRP] Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Project
\item[resource] Content that is managed from a usage perspective.
\item[rules] A specific description of how a resource can be used.
\item[smashup] A secure mashup application.
\item[subject] An actor that uses a resource.
\item[usage management] Managing all aspects of use of an item.
\item[usage management mechanism] A component that manages the use of a resource.
