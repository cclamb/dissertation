\begin{beamerboxesrounded}[shadow]{Contribution of Work}
The contribution of this work is a quantitative analysis of policy-centric overlay network options, associated taxonomies of use, and prototypical technology proofs-of-concept.
\end{beamerboxesrounded}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Network Control Options} --- This includes various types networks and associated strengths and weaknesses addressing centralized and decentralized models.
\item \textit{Taxonomies of Use} --- Depending on the specific usage management requirements and context, different overlays have different applicability; this work will provide guidance on suitability; it will eventually lead to how to manage data flow within SDN-capable infrastructure.
\item \textit{Prototypical Technologies} --- Examples and proofs-of-concept will be required to appropriately analyze various architectural alternatives.
