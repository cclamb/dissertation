This work introduces the notion of usage management embedded in a delivery network itself.  It also provides an in-depth analysis of the challenges and principles involved in the design of an open, inter-operable usage management framework that operates over this kind of environment. Besides referencing the material covered in depth to portray the current state of the art, the analysis includes application of well-known principles of system design and standards~~\cite{Blumenthal:2001:RDI:383034.383037,Clark:1995:DPD:205447.205458,ClWrSoBr:02}, research developments in the areas of usage control~~\cite{PaSa:04,JaHeLa:10}, policy languages design principles~~\cite{JaHeMa:06}, digital rights management (DRM) systems~~\cite{JaHe:09},  and interoperability~~\cite{JaHe:04,HeJa:05,KoLaMaMi:04,coral,marlin} towards the development of supporting frameworks.

While a large body of work exists on how overlay networks can use policies for \textit{network} management, very little work has been done on using usage policies for \textit{content} management.  The primary contribution in this area focuses on dividing a given system into specific \textit{security domains} which are governed by individual policies ~\cite{4457175}.  This system fits into this proposed taxonomy as an $\alpha$-type system as it has domains with single separating guards.

A large body of work currently exists with respect to security in and over overlay networks.  These kinds of techniques and this area of study is vital to the production development and delivery of overlay systems, but is outside the scope of this work.
