\begin{abstract}
Herein, we contrast filter-centric diode and policy-centric overlay approaches toward usage management of sensitive content from the perspective of cross-domain solutions and then demonstrate a path from current systems to distributed policy-centric overlay methods.  We first cover the need for overlay networks supporting usage management by highlighting the pending migration to utility computing models and the current shortcomings of those kinds of systems from a variety of perspectives.  We also briefly cover the state of usage management within these kinds of systems, also examining the known state of the art in proposed cross domain solutions.  The then compare and contrast the advantages of policy-based overlay systems to solving usage management issues over sensitive material and demonstrate a migration path from current to future solutions.  We close with our current and future directions of research.

\subsection{Cross Domain Solutions}
The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) supports efforts do develop other specific solutions that have been presented over the past few years within the government space to handle this kind of information management.  The National Security Agency set the standard in this area initially.  In 2009, at a conference sponsored by the UCDMO, Booz $\mid$ Allen $\mid$ Hamilton and Raytheon presented alternative notional architectures contrasting with current NSA-influenced approaches \cite{proposal:nsa-arch,proposal:gig-arch,proposal:bah-arch,proposal:raytheon-arch}.
