\begin{abstract}
Herein, we establish a model for quantitatively examining system architectures and then use that model to evaluate a taxonomy of proposed architectural configurations of overlay networks for usage management.
We first cover the need for overlay networks supporting usage management by highlighting the pending migration to utility computing models and the current shortcomings of those kinds of systems from a variety of perspectives.  We also briefly cover the state of usage management within these kinds of systems, also examining the known state of the art in proposed cross domain solutions.  We then cover a method for evaluating these kinds of systems and then use this method to evaluate a taxonomy of proposed overlay systems for usage managment.  We close with our current and future directions of research.

\subsection{Cross Domain Solutions}
The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) supports efforts do develop other specific solutions that have been presented over the past few years within the government space to handle this kind of information management.  The National Security Agency set the standard in this area initially.  In 2009, at a conference sponsored by the UCDMO, Booz $\mid$ Allen $\mid$ Hamilton and Raytheon presented alternative notional architectures contrasting with current NSA-influenced approaches \cite{proposal:nsa-arch,proposal:gig-arch,proposal:bah-arch,proposal:raytheon-arch}.
